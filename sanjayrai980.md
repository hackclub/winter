# Project Name
Custom Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

I want to make a custom keyboard using Cherry MX switches and K8 barebone Case. As a programmer and a hardware enthusiast I was thinking 
of building a custom keyboard and I found Winter Hardware Wonderland the perfect to build it.

## Plan

First of all ordering all the part required for making the keyboard from the supplier, The switches, keycaps and the case for holding 
all the things together. Second is assemblying the partes together like installing the switches in the case and inserting the keycaps.
Third gonna be the testing phase where we test the custom build keyboard in PC and
