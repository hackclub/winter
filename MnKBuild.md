# Project Name

75% Keyboard and mouse build

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

I'm finally delving into the realm of hardware for the first time and this is my first time. I want to build something that can help me and will go to being an irreplacable component part of my desk setup in my student life. That is: a mechanical keyboard, something that helps me write, code and study for long hours while just giving me pure pleasure to type on. To complement this and make it the best desk setup, I will be getting a budget Mac mouse, and I'm extremely eager for this as this is surprisingly, my first mouse.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
1. First I will proceed to go ahead and assemble the custom keyboard case, and wire the PCB together
2. Snapping in and adjusting the mounting plates
3. I will screw in and mod up the stabilisers for it to hold up the keyboard.
4. Lubricating the switches and testing them
5. Snapping on the switches on respective keys
6. Assemble the keycaps on
7. Developing and designing the macros and customising functionality

This is a brief dummy's guide (basically for me cuz it's my first time) into building a keyboard. I will be using various resources such as this [article](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/build-custom-mechanical-keyboard) and a couple of other YouTube videos for this.

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
