# DIY Smart Home

## Summary

A smart home. I'm moving houses soon, so I want to automate most of the things I do at home. Turning on the lights? I'd rather do it from my phone. 
No need for cloud storage or AI assistants. Additionally, this can serve as a home server for me, to store / stream content on to my TV. I'll use a Raspberry Pi 
with displays, one always on for brief information and one for detailed control, only turned on when requested, and I'll play around with testing on various household 
items when I move. Leaving some budget for things I might need along the way and inflation. Considering I have major exams next year (2023), I'd be doing this to keep 
it simple enough that I can balance my work and time setting this up. I'll most likely be using something like Home Assistant to connect the devices and use the Pi as
something like a hub.

## Plan

I'll start off with playing around with the displays and Pi, figuring out software for the first few days, seeing how much I can fit on the displays. 
Then, I'll set up the various devices around the house, and for the next few days I'll probably be troubleshooting firmware and software, seeing how this can all go 
together. After I set up the smart home things, I'll be setting up a server on the Pi (hopefully it can handle it) to stream content / store content for me to watch on 
my TV. I'll be experimenting with different software, but I'll most likely stick to Home Assistant.
