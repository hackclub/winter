# Extra Fancy Alarm Clock

## Summary

My alarm clock broke, but it was lame anyway. My goal is to build one that can:
- Tell the time
- Display random information
- Play music
- Listen to voice commands
- Connect to the Internet

## Plan

In order to accomplish such a feat, I plan to simply connect a Raspberry Pi to an LED matrix, pushbutton, speakers, and microphone, then put it all in a 3D-printed case.
I've already programmed a basic voice assistant in Python, so I'll just drive the LED matrix with it too.
I was going to use a wired keypad with the GPIO, but the LED matrix hat makes that annoying so I'll settle for a USB keypad. However, I may switch out the keycaps for 3D printed ones down the road.
