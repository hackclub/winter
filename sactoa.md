# Project Name

Moving Camera

## Summary

I am going to build a camera that can move back and forth with Raspberry Pi. I record YouTube videos, so this will be especially great for me:
I plan on having the camera use facial recognition to follow me around as I show various objects. $250 isn't enough to add this, but I eventually want 
to add voice recognition, so I can have certain movement or clipping occur when I say specific words. 

## Plan

I am going to put the parts together as intended by the Pi engineers. The ingenuity on my part will be within the code: choosing the specific
functionality I want my camera to have. For facial recognition, I will use OpenCV. My main language will be Python because it works with OpenCV and is
the main language to use with Raspberry Pis. I also want to include the moviepy module to edit my videos with scripts within the camera(using my computer
as an interface).
