# LED Cube

## Summary

I will be to constructing a cube-shaped object with a 4x4 array of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs). This LED 4x4 cube can be used for various purpose like display, decoration, etc. It will involve soldering and programming to control the LEDs and bring the cube to life.

## Plan

Gather materials: You will need 64 LEDs, a soldering iron, soldering wire, a microcontroller (such as an Arduino), wires for connecting the microcontroller to the LEDs, and a power source.

Plan the wiring: Sketch out a diagram of the cube, showing where each LED will be placed and how it will be wired to the microcontroller.

Solder the LEDs: Carefully solder the LEDs to a circuit board, making sure to connect the anodes and cathodes correctly.

Connect the microcontroller: Wire the microcontroller to the circuit board, connecting the appropriate pins to the anodes and cathodes of the LEDs.

Write the code: Use a programming language such as C++ to write code that will control the LEDs, determining when and how they will light up.

Assemble the cube: Carefully connect the circuit board to the structure of the cube, connecting all the LEDs and making sure the wiring is correct.

Test and debug: Test the cube to make sure it functions correctly, and debug any issues that may arise.

Power on: Connect a power source to the cube, and power it on. The cube should now be fully functional, displaying different patterns and animations.
