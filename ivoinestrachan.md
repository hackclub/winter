# SkateBoard Collision

## Summary

The skateboard safety alert system is a device that uses sensors to detect potential collisions and sounds an alarm to alert the skateboarder. It includes a microcontroller, sensors, and an audio output device and requires code to be written to process sensor data and play the alarm sound. The system aims to improve skateboard safety by alerting skateboarders to potential collisions and helping them avoid accidents.

## Plan

I am going to first get a sensor to detect the collision using a microcontroller and using a arduino then test if im going to hit then a alarm goes off. I am also going to make a vlog from this and I think its going to be pretty cool. I had to limit my imagination and get a lower budget because shipping stuff to The Bahamas is to pricey.

## Budget

| Skateboard  | https://a.co/d/bpwPXxN | $37.00 |
| Arduino Kit | Already Owned          | $0     |
| Total       | Taxes & Shipping       | $57.49 |
