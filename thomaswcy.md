# Home-Environment-Monitor (HEV)

## Summary

I'm going to build the HEV using RaspberryPi and sensors. It will be deployed on Linux. I'm excited because though I have lots experiences in Linux but I'm totally new to Raspberry. I am building this with my friend @MeliLXT and with the help from my friend @xingyujie, which is very familiar with RaspberryPi.

It will use light, sound, temperature and humidity sensors.

## Plan

I'm going to use RaspberryPi 4b to control all the sensors. It will run the RaspberryPi OS. I will control the sensors using Python and bash scripts. The data will be printed out using a electron.js application.

This is my first project based on RaspberryPi and I will be very excited.
