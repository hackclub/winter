# Mechanically Codable Robot

## Summary

We are going to build a single motor robot that is able to read and execute mechanical "code" on a wheel. It will use gears to rotate the wheel around, and extrusions around the wheel will physical manipulate the robot such that it is able to turn and move. We have always loved the idea of mechanical coding, and we really want to be able to make a robot that can use it. This is our first ever project that is anything like this, so we are excited to see how it turns out.

## Plan

1) Brainstorm how the robot will read the mechanical wheel and turn it into an output (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD_MLuMvkNw - Reference for Mechanical Coding Robots, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBi0ecy5kPs - Reverse Gear Directions)

2) Use Fusion 360 to design the components of the robot. This will include a holder for the motor, multiple interchangable wheels that can each code the robot to to diffferent things, and a system of gears and other parts that will be able to turn that code into motion. 

3) Print out all of the parts on the 3D printer (https://youtube.com/watch?v=iF5TEdEGyg8 - 3D Printer Review, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpM5pSSYq2c - Unboxing and Setup)

4) Assmemble all of the parts and test!
