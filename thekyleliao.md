# The Urban Kayak

## Summary

I am going to build a foldable kayak with RGB lights controlled using an arduino with Hong Wong’s Origami Kayak Plans along with DIY paddles. The purpose is to create a kayak portable enough that I could take it on the bus and bring it around NYC’s waterways and hopefully avoid drowning. In the future, I want to add an underwater camera system for fish sight seeing.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
