# Project Name

## Summary

I am going to build a server that I can use to host a multitude of different applications. I am especially excited because this will be a big help to the development of my Spigot minecraft plugin, as I will have a designated server that I can have people playtest on. I will also be hosting a webserver where I can store a public portfolio of my projects. I am hoping to learn more about how computers work and how they are put together.

## Plan

I will need a scewdriver, my hands, and a lot of time. The first step will be installation of the CPU into the motherboard, the installation of the cooler, then the RAM, and then the plugging in of the power supply. I will also have to do some work on the software side to setup my server with an OS. It sounds basic now, but I imagine I'll have to do plenty of troubleshooting.

## Budget

I already have a hard drive so I added it below but with a price of $0.00
