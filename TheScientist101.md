# Smart RC Car With AI Camera

## Summary

I am going to build an RC car chassis that carries a smart camera. This car will have a smart camera that can detect objects and can inform the driver to react accordingly. The car will be controlled with an app on my phone and data from the car will be sent back to the phone. I am excited to build this because this is a unique project for me. I have never worked on a hardware related project before, but combining my knowledge about software and hardware will create a product that is (hopefully) fun to play with, and easy to use.

## Plan

Once my parts arrive, I will first assemble the chassis without the camera and raspberry pi, but with the microcontroller for control. The microcontroller will have a different battery pack than the motors, listed below. This should take the first 2-3 days of the challenge. For the hardware in the chassis, I will loosely follow this. https://learn.adafruit.com/my-mini-race-car/introduction Next, I will work on the app to control just the robot without any of the sensory information. This will approximately take another 2-3 days. Third, I will add the raspberry pi and its camera. The raspberry pi will be powered by another battery powerbank. This should take less than a day depending on the other work I have that day. Finally, I will add the sensory functionality to the app. This should take approximately 2-4 days and the project will be complete.
