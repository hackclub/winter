Summary

I’m going to be building a robotic hexapod and car which are controlled using an Arduino board that I can have fun building. The goal of this project is to create something that is super cool that I can control using a remote to move. I am also going to build an Arduino controlled smart lamp which I would use in my bedroom.


Plan

I’ll be ordering an Arduino uno kit off of Amazon which will give me all the tools and equipment needed for building all the projects. Then I will order the robot kits for a hexapod and car which I will assemble and connect and control with the Arduino using the instructions as well as YouTube videos online. For the smart lamp I will be using the Yeelight and putting it in my lamp which will be wired to the Arduino allowing me to control it. I will also be following a YouTube video for this.
