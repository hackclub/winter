# LED Strips Soldering

## Summary

I am going to build LED strip lights. They can be used for a variety of purposes such as lighting up a room or creating unique lighting effects. I am excited to build it because it is a fun and interesting project that will allow me to learn more about soldering and electronic circuits. Additionally, LED strip lights can be very cool and can add a unique touch to any space.I will be learning about soldering by joining different components together to create a functional circuit. This will include learning about different types of LED lights, resistors and other components that are used in LED strip lights. Additionally, I will learn about power supply and how to properly wire the LED strip lights. I am excited to take on this project as it will allow me to learn new skills and create something cool and unique that can be used to enhance any space.!

## Plan

1. Gathering supplies.
2. Learning about the components- Before starting I will learn about the different components and what their functions are. I will learn how to solder and also practice soldering.
3. I will decide on the layout and design of my LED STRIP LIGHTS. I will deteermine where the resistors and the power supply will be placed. 
4. I will carefully use my soldering skills to solder the led strips and the resistors and also make sure that all connections are working.
5. Once everything is build I will test the circuit and fix anything if required
6. Add it to my room.
