## Reference [Remote Control Car](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/samanfern/bluetooth-controlled-car-d5d9ca)
(This is the one closest to my plan and i would make changes to my liking which are mentioned below)

## Summary
This would be my first step towards using microcontrollers and i am super exited to do it.
I would be building multiple projects with the use of Arduino. I always wanted to build projects with the use of miro-controllers but never got a chance to build one.

## Plan

I first objective with this project will be to create a simple project like a motion sensor that detects when someone is coming near my room. I would also try to build diffrent things like a gas sensor before I get started with the main project to acquire the basic knowledge of Arduino.
<br>
The small toy car would help me with learning programing like controling all 4 motors seprately using motor driver

### 1. Get The materials
- Get everything required for this project along with other everyday thing (like cardboard)

### 2. Build a frame for toy car
- Plan the car in blender using simple shapes like cuboid and celender to get it proper placement and dimmensions of the components
- Build the frame using cardboard cut in proper dimmensions with the help of the 3D model made earlier in blender

### 2.5. Builing the toy car with simple program using only sensor

### 3. Getting Stated with the actual build of main Remote Control Toy Car
The project would be about 40% complete after step 2.5 , But the main challenge for me would be to make it remote control, and do the programming 
- Attach the Bluetooth reciever and do basic programming for controlling the Motor Driver
- Programe the basic accelerate and reverse 
- Try to make the left and right by controling the speed of each motor 
- Test the Prototype and edit the code to run things more smoothly

### 4. Done
