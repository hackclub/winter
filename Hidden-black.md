## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?
I would be building multiple projects with the use of Arduino. I always wanted to build projects with the use of miro-controllers but never got a chance to build one.

## Plan

I first objective with this project will be to create a simple project like a motion sensor that detects when someone is coming near my room. I would also try to build diffrent things like a gas sensor before I get started with the main project to acquire the basic knowledge of Arduino.

The small toy car would help me with learning programing like controling all 4 motors seprately using motor driver
