# Project Name

## Summary

I would love to create a mechanical keyboard from scratch. This would be my first exposure to hardware because almost all my projects are software. I'm excited for this because I never had the opportunity to learn how to solder. I've seen vids on people making RC cars and I'm curious to see what rabbit hole this leads me down. However, going hotswappable could save like 40 dollars. 

## Plan

I will be following [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzWm40Tq4F4) to buy and [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ujz-noZKk) to solder.
I will assemble the PCB, plate, and case on the first few days and spend a couple days soldering. I will apply lube and assemble the switches, stablizers, and keycaps on the final days.
