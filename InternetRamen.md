# Project Name

## Summary

I would love to create a mechanical keyboard from scratch. This would be my first exposure to hardware because almost all my projects are software.
I don't have a soldering iron, so I don't think it would be worth it to buy a solderable set.

## Plan

I will be following [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzWm40Tq4F4) to buy and [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deVaUvywGMw) to build.
I will assemble the PCB, plate, and case on the first few days and lube and assemble the switches, stablizers, and keycaps on the next days.
**LMK if soldering and PCB from scratch would be required!**
