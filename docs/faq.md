# FAQ

#### I'm in college. Can I join this event? 

No, this event is only open to current high school students (or younger).

##### Can I join the event if I'm not in the US?

Yes, this event is open to everyone. However, Hack Club Bank, the platform you'll be using to receive and spend the grant money may or may not work as well outside of North America. Using Hack Club Bank outside of the North America is still experimental. We'd love to still hear from you and will try our best to help make it work!

Here's a nice rundown of all the [countries](eligible_countries.md) that can/cannot use Bank.

##### What if I don't have a project idea?

Check out the [examples](/examples) for inspiration. If you're still stuck, you can ask for help in the [#hardware-party](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0168BR5PDE) channel on Slack.

##### Can multiple people team up to work on a project?

If you team up with an IRL friend and want to build a project together, you would work together to submit one pull request. All teammates must meet requirements for the event (eg. under 18, have submitted RSVP, be on Slack, etc.) The grant amount would be for up to $250 per person, growing with team size. You must be able to meet up in person to work on the project with your teammate(s). The maximum number of people in a team is 4.

##### How many total grants are there availalbe?

Currently, there is no limit for the number of grants available. This is be subject to change depending on the volume of project proposals.

##### Can we build multiple small projects instead of one project?

You can build multiple small projects as long as you can outline a plan to complete them during the 10-day event.

##### Does the entire project have to cost less than $250?

The project may have a budget exceeding $250. However, you would be responsible for covering the difference by adding money to your Hack Club Bank account.

##### What if I need more funds than initially planned?

If your initial grant was less than $250, and you find yourself needing to order extra parts, reach out to the Bank team at bank@hackclub.com to request additional funds.

##### When will my pull request be reviewed?

We'll try our best to review within 48 hours. However, there may be delays around federal holidays in the United States.

##### Will we have to pay the 7% fee for Hack Club Bank?

The 7% fiscsal sponsorship fee will be waived for Winter Hardware Wonderland grant funds. If your project's budget exceeds $250, and you need more funds to build your project, there will be no fee to add personal funds to your account.

##### Should my budget include shipping and taxes?

Please do include shipping and taxes so the grant amount you receive will be as close as possible to your project expenses.
