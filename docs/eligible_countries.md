# Does Hack Club Bank work in your country?

You'll be receiving your grant through [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank) and purchasing your hardware using a Hack Club Bank Visa card. Unfortunately, in some countries, Hack Club Bank doesn't work because merchants aren't able to accept payment using international Visa cards.

Hack Club Bank hasn't been used widely outside of North America, so there are many countries whose statuses are still unknown. If your country isn't listed here, you are still welcome to submit a project proposal. While we can't guarantee that Hack Club Bank will work in your country, we invite you to try it out.

Due to US government sanction sanctions, Visa cards will not work in the following countries:

Balkans, Belarus, Central African Republic, Congo, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Russia, Venezuela, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.

[See the US Treasury website for an up-to-date list of sanctions programs.](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information)

Due to India's restrictive policy on foreign transactions, Hack Club Bank cards may be declined by most major merchants in India. Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/blob/main/docs/india.md) for more information on using Hack Club Bank in India.
