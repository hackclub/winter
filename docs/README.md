This winter, we challenged our community to — over 10 days — build any hardware project they wanted and we supported them with individual grants of up to $250.

High schoolers from 32 countries created [gesture-controlled robots](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/blob/main/ManikShrivastav.md), [smart snack machines](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/blob/main/masonnamminga.md), [PCs from scratch](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/blob/main/Cooper7196.md) and more. The goal of this repository is to be a resource of 249 hardware projects for makers of all abilities, built by high schoolers.

_WHW is a project by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that supports a network of 20k+ technical high schoolers._


## ⛷ The rundown

| **$75k**  | **249**    | **321**   | **2,000**       | **871**   | 
| ----------| -----------| --------- | --------------- | ----------|
| 💸 grants | 🚢 projects | 🧑‍💻 makers | 💳 transactions | 🔍 updates |

In mid-december, we challenged the community to gather 500 RSVPs before we opened sign ups and we reached that in less than a week, gathering 1k+ RSVPs in total.

To keep the process transparent, Hack Clubbers interested in participating signed up by making a pull request to this repository with their project idea. After a short review process that checked for project viability and suitability, they were onboarded to Hack Club Bank (how we disbursed grants), and within one week started purchasing their components.

From Feb 14-23, Hack Clubbers shared project updates in our online [Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) community with [#scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/about) posts, check them out [here](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/r/winter-hardware-wonderland)!

## 💰 The grants

Grant disbursements were powered by [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank), our fiscal sponsor and banking platform which allowed us to keep them transparent and also send money directly to high schoolers without waiting for institutional support.
