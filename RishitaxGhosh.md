# Project Name
STEMabled


## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

We have grown up with STEM being the very foundation of our learning, and believe it to be of the utmost importance to bring this opportunity of learning to every student in our country. 
A small yet significant step in that direction is our project STEMabled, an initiative to bring STEMabled kits to the visually impaired. We would like to explore the field 
of assistive technology and contribute to inclusive designs, in near future we will work on creating a hands-on science curriculum & kits for the blind. 

Harpunnet and I have been an active volunteer for the visually impaired community. We, along with our juniors, will develop a 3D printed Braille Embosser for communication & Walk-Bot to 
help navigate visually impaired students. 


## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

DIY Braille Embosser: 
1. We would design our parts on Fusion 360 or TinkerCAD 
2. Print the parts on a 3D printer
3. Assemble the Parts 
4. Test out with a couple of blind students & teachers
5. Work on furthur improvements as suggested through feedback

Walk-Bot: 
1. Design the base case layout on Fusion 360 or TinkerCAD 
2. 3D Print the case
3. Make connections and code the sensors with arduino uno 
4. Integrate the whole system
5. Test it out & get feedback
