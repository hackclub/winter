# Plant Location Chooser

## Summary

I am planning to build an arduino project that will take parameters like the temprature and it will decide if the location is suitable for growing a plant.  
It will then communicate those result by bluetooth on a mobile device using a custom app.  
I am excited to work on this project because I live in a rural area and we have a lot of flowers that we need to take care of and this would be the perfect tool to help plant more flowers.

## Plan

For the first day I will make all the neccessary schematics I would need to use.  
For the next 2 or 3 days I will make the android app using Flutter.  
The rest of the days will be spent constructing, programming and testing the project.
