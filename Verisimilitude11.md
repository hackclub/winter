# IoT Plant Watering System

## Summary

I am going to build a smart plant watering system that uses a microcontroller and sensors to automatically water my plants based on soil moisture levels. I am excited to build this project because I love plants, but I often forget to water them. This system will help me take better care of my plants and save water by only watering when needed.

## Plan

3. Purchase the components and materials needed for the project.
4. Assemble the system using the microcontroller, sensors, pump, and water reservoir.
5. Write code for the microcontroller to control the pump based on the moisture levels detected by the sensors in the Arduino IDE/MicroPython.
6. Test the system to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
7. Make any necessary adjustments or improvements to the system.
8. Make a web server for the NodeMCU ESP8266 to allow me to control and view the sensor data at all times via the internet
9. Cover all parts in a custom cut wood frame

I'm planning on following the following guides:
