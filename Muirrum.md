# MIDI GO Box v2

## Summary

An older [LnL](https://lnl.wpi.edu) project was the "MIDI Go Box" -- a small box with various buttons on it that could be used to trigger lighting cues. It was broken a few months before I arrived at WPI, and now I'm going to be resurrecting it!

## Plan

1. Schematic in KiCAD
2. Write Arduino software
3. Breadboard with switches and MIDI testing
4. CAD new case
5. Assemble finished project

I'm planning on basing this around an Arduino Leonardo to take advantage of the extra

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
