# 75% Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

I'm going to build my first mechanical keyboard and have decided to go with the 75% layout. I've wanted to build my own keyboard for a long time and I'm excited to utilize this hardware grant to be able to do so. This keyboard will become my everyday keyboard.

## Plan

I will not need any other tools outside what is already included below.

* Day 1 will be spent separating my switches so that I can lube them the next day.
* On Days 2 to 5, I will oil the springs, lube the switches, and put switch film on them. I will do this in batches so that I won't be overwhelmed by the number of switches I have to go through. I will test the switches as I make them to ensure they sound the way I want to.
* Day 6 is dedicated to putting the switches into the NJ80.
* Day 7 is for putting the keycaps onto my keyboard.
* Days 8 to 10 are for the final touches on the keyboard. I will ensure every key works and is sounding the way I like. I might even reprogram a couple of the keys but I'll decide that later on.
