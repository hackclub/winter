# System Monitor

## Summary

I want to build a system monitor for a computer that allows you to see CPU, RAM, and disk usage. Also, because I've been coding off an ancient laptop (with a grand total of 2GB of RAM) I want to use this chance to get a computer that serves my needs.

## Plan

For the first day, I'd probably be setting up the computer, installing an OS, and just overall learning about the computer. After that, I'd probably be learning about low-level stuff, and understanding how to get the usage information. I plan to use something like [Tauri](https://tauri.app) to create a screen to display everything. It seems to have an API that allows me to get the usage and information, so I could research that.
