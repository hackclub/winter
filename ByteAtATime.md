# Project Name

## Summary

I've been wanting to try to build a mechanical keyboard for a while, and since I'm only starting with hardware and stuff I think I want to start with something simple and building a mechanical keyboard looks pretty simple (from the videos I've seen).

Also, the current keyboard I have is really crappy and my brother really hates the sound, but since I'm broke I don't really have a good reason to waste my earnings.

This would be my first time lubing switches, so that's a learning experience.

I also plan to add a KDE widget to tell me information such as whether caps lock is on and stuff like that.

(Not sure if this project counts though)

## Plan

Self-explanatory, ig just build the keyboard. I also want to see the PCB and try to understand how it works.
