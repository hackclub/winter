# Pomodoro Timer/TODO List

## Summary

I plan to build a [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer that includes a basic task list/management system. I have a problem with time management, which is important as I'm a student, and I'm building this in hopes that I can get better at it and finish my tasks on time.

## Plan

For the UI, I plan to use something like [Tauri](https://tauri.app). For educational purposes, I'm going to overengineer the system to use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) (Firestore in particular) to store the task information, along with statistics of Pomodoro's I've done.

## Budget

| Product         | Supplier/Link                         | Cost   |

| Total           |                                       | $214.98 |
