# Camera Based Door Access Control System

## Summary

I am going to build a camera based door access control system that uses facial recognition to grant or deny access to a locked door. 
The system will include a camera mounted near the door, a small computer for processing the video feed and running the facial recognition algorithm, and a lock mechanism that can be controlled by the computer. 
I am excited to build this because I think it has the potential to improve security and convenience in a variety of settings, such as office buildings, apartment complexes, and homes.

## Plan

1. Gather materials and tools needed:
    * Raspberry Pi microcomputer
    * Raspberry Pi camera module
    * Servo motor
    * Lock mechanism (such as a deadbolt or latch bolt)
    * Wires and connectors
    * Power supply
2. Set up the Raspberry Pi and camera module according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Connect the servo motor to the Raspberry Pi and wire it to control the lock mechanism.
4. Write and upload code to the Raspberry Pi that will:
    * Continuously capture video from the camera
    * Run the facial recognition algorithm on the video feed
    * Grant or deny access to the door based on the result of the facial recognition
5.Test the system to ensure it is functioning properly.
6. Install the camera, servo motor, and lock mechanism near the desired door.
