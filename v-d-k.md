# Project Name
building 60% keyboard

## Summary
Building a 60% keyboard can be a challenging and fun DIY project for me. It involves sourcing and assembling the various components of the keyboard, including the case, PCB (printed circuit board), switches, keycaps, and USB cable.

## Plan
1. Gather materials: Purchase or gather all of the necessary components for your keyboard, including the PCB, switches, keycaps, case, and USB cable. Make sure to choose high-quality components that will be reliable and durable.

2. Assemble the PCB: Solder the switches onto the PCB according to the layout you have chosen. This can be a time-consuming and delicate process, so it is important to take your time and be careful. You may want to practice soldering on a scrap PCB or practice soldering kit before attempting to solder the switches onto the actual PCB.

3. Install the keycaps: Snap the keycaps onto the switches, making sure they are properly aligned and seated. You may want to use a keycap puller tool to help with this process.

4. Assemble the case: Put the PCB, keycaps, and other components into the case and secure them in place according to the instructions for your specific case. This may involve screwing the PCB into the case, attaching the feet or stabilizers, and connecting the USB cable.
