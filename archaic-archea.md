# Lilly's Software Distribution

## Summary

Lilly's Software Distribution aims to provide a proper operating system for 64 bit RISC-V.
It also aims to provide good sources for learning about operating system development for newer coders.
Hopefully this can provide a basis for a larger community for operating system development that will provide more innovation, as well as a more accepting community.

## Plan

I plan on distributing information about this project through streams, as well as through communication centers for operating systems.
I plan to set up streaming for places such as Youtube, or Twitch, and attempt to foster a kind, and open community.
I will also try and encourage people to go towards groups that aim to teach about operating systems and their functions.
Finally, I plan on helping more easily find guides and information on how to start for beginners.

## Budget

I will likely need a development board, all the other materials I need, such as a monitor, a laptop for coding it on, and power connectors, are already with me.
