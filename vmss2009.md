# ATL Notice Board

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

ATL(Atal Tinkering Labs) are like makerspaces established by NITI-AAYOG, Government of India in 10,000 schools. Around 1.2 million 
students utilize these labs.

I am planning to build a notice board (LED Display board) for the students who attend these labs to know their assigned tinkering activities, project timelines, 
competitions schedule etc...This will be achieved by identifying themselves by showing student RFID card. The RFID reader enables us to recognise the student, 
will show up student record of tinkering activities.

I am excited to built it as it helps students manage their experiments, tasks and they can spend more time on the innovation rather than
managing the activities

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

Develop a webapp using flutterflow and curate content from ATL activities which needs to be displayed on a monitor that is powered on
for the whole duration of the ATL. A raspberry pi would act as a computing device to run our webapp. An RFID card reader would be connected to
Raspberry Pi module and individual RFID cards would be issued to students.

7 pins (out of a total of 8) of RFID reader are to be connected to RPI.

Firstly we will register all the RFID's issued to students into the Firestore database. When a student shows up with 
an RFID tag to get his data, a unique ID  for each RFID will be sent to RPi. We will create an API in which the RPi 
will call it (POST request) and send the unique ID to the API and it returns the student name for the presented unique 
ID. UniqueID is  checked in the Firestore database and the client (flutterflow) will invoke the API whenever the POST 
request is called. By that we can get the name of the student from the RFID reader to our client. Then we will check 
the schedule of the respective student by retrieving it from the Firestore database.



Tools : -

1. Monitor
2. Rapberry pi 4
3. HDMI connector
4. Wireless Keyboard and Mouse
5. Bootable SD Card
6. Flutter flow subscription
7. RFID cards
8. RFID Card reader

Steps : -

Step 1 - Develop a webapp using flutterflow (low code platform). This is used to curate content to be displayed in the notice board.
Step 2 - A raspberry pi 4 to run a webapp.
Step 3 - An RFID card reader to recognize student uniquely.
Step 4 - Connect RPI to RFID reader 
Step  - A monitor is needed to display digital notice board of the respective student whose RFID card is used.
