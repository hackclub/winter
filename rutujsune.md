# 6" FPV Drone 

## Summary

I am going to build a full sized FPV Drone using a 6" props frame, that transmits video from its FPV cam using a Video Transmitter(VTX) to a 5.8 GHz receiver screen.I am buildng this with the help of my friend @aryatajne28. I have compiled all the compatible components for this frame. This drone can be used for racing purpose, Cinematic FPV shooting, etc. As I have used Analog FPV system in this so instead of FPV Goggles, I was able to use a Receiver Display to get it under budget! 
I am updating it as some of the components went out of stock. So I am adding a new frame, new stack, VTX, motors, propellors and FPV goggles.

## Plan

First of all, I was inspired to build my own FPV drone when I first watched this playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwoDb7WF6c8neIAQBkchfiXf-C8KbzG5M)
So, I will be following this playlist to Plan my own build accordingly.
### Assembly-
  I and my friend will start with the assembly of the frame, starting with the bottom plate, I will screw the motors on the arms of the frame, following with the propellors. After this, I will then assemble the Flight Controller and ESC Stack doing the wiring at the same time. After that I will install the VTX and the receiver module. After this I will install the FPV Camera on place. This finishes the installing procedure. I am planning to do this in the first 2 days of my building.
### Battery Testing-
  Before installing the top plate of the frame, I need to ensure that I have soldered everything correctly and everythings ready to go. If I get any errors, like my Flight Controller doesn't light up or something else, I will have to look upon the issue and solve it. This will be done in the next 2 days.
### Setup-
  After wiring and assembly is done, I will move forward to setup my quad so that everything like Flight Controller, VTX, Receiver, Transmitter are all connected and working fine. To do this I will be using Betaflight software to setup the whole Firmware of my drone. I will try to complete this process in next 2 days of the build.
### Putting all things together!-
  When everything's done, I will assemble the drone finally, like attaching the battery staps, etc. I will ensure everything is in place and tight enough. I will go through every corner of the drone and check everything. This will take 1 day.
### Testing-
  And the final and the most interesting part of our build is to test and fly the drone right away. I will be testing the drone in a open ground with the video transmission directly fed into the Display screen. And here our build ends.
## Budget

I have checked and reviewed all the components, that are compatible with this build. I have done research on what components would be the best according to my budget. Here it the list:
