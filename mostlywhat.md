# MFE-SD or Multi-Function Electronic Control/Steering Device

## Summary

I will be building a multi-function steering wheel/flight yoke combination. As I have started this project back then to suit my needs for cars and flight simulators, but I lacked the equipments to make them. I am excited about this project as I wanted to fly a plane, but also to play racing games with my friends.

## Plan

Assembly Steps:
Redesign my Old Arduino Schematics for cleaner results in code and wiring.
Build Yoke System (Suspension).
Design the connection between components (Assembly).

Polishing Steps:
Design Packaging (Cleanup).
Test System with Games.
External and Internal Fixes.
Bug Fixes.
