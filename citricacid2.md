# IntelliBag | A smart backpack that might be illegal to bring on airplanes

## Summary

**What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?**

I'm going to build a smart backpack that's loaded with all sorts of cool tech features!

Feature breakdown:

- I'm planning to include an integrated battery that can charge my laptop, phone, and other devices right inside the backpack
- This battery will provide power for all of the essential circuits inside the backpack.
- The outside will have accesible USB ports, and a detachable MagSafe charger.
- The arm straps will be lined with independently addressable RGB LEDs that both provide aesthetic and practical benefits.
- The back of the bag will have a large RGB display that can be used for aesthetic purposes or for safety, such as break lights, turn signals, etc.
- The zippers will have magnetic contacts to detect if the bag is open or closed. The LEDs can be used to indicate this.
- All attached devices and the internal battery will be able to be charged from a single USB-C port on the outside of the bag.
- The backpack's features will be controllable via bluetooth from a mobile app.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

Steps:

1. Get materials
2. Begin Circuits on a breadboard (connecting microcontroller to LEDs, etc.)
3. Begin programming microcontroller
4. Assemble system independently of bag.
5. Convert breadboard to protoboard.
6. Begin creating compartments, flaps, and cutouts on the bag
7. Begin stiching and sewing the electronics into the bag.
8. Finalize microcontroller programming
9. Create mobile interface
10. Look into more advanced features (motion detection/a way to detect if the bag is being stolen, etc.)
11. Look into modularity

Tools:

- Soldering Equipment
  - Iron
  - Helping hands
  - etc.
- Breadboarding
- Sewing Kit
- Hot Glue
- Computer for programming
