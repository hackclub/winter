# Project Name

## Summary

I'm building an IOT weather sensing module that reports weather conditions to a user and allows them to plan their day accordingly. e.g
if the temperature is very warm, and humidity is high, they can plan to dress lightly or to take an umbrella along. In time, a machine learning algorithm
will be developed to make long-term predictions about weather. I am excited because of the implications of this project for agriculture.
Seasons are very unpredictable nowadays, and so the long-term projections made by this project would be more beneficial to farmers than traditional seasonal planning.

## Plan

I am going to use the following sensors: a temperature sensor, humidity sensor, air pressure sensor, rain gauge, soil moisture sensor, light intensity sensor, and a wind speed sensor.
The first step is to complete the hardware connections and set up the companion application to send information from the microcontroller to my phone. Every hour, there will be a reminder for the user to
check the weather conditions. All of these readings will be sent to a Firsetore database until tehe machine learning algorithm is developed.
The algorithm will be trained on the data in the database so that it'll detect patterns and be able to make long term predictions about the weather.
