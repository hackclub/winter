# Humidifier with moisture sensor

## Summary

Especially during the winter, the air in my room gets really dry. I am building an air humidifier with an adjustable humidity level based on [this](https://github.com/AlexGyver/EnglishProjects/tree/master/autoHumidifier). It will have a small display to show the temperature and humidity levels. Also, a rotary encoder to set the wanted humidity level. I will 3D-print the case. I will be leaving out the water level sensor because the tank will be reasonably big.

## Plan

Tools:
- 3D printer
- soldering iron (already owned)
- drill (already owned)
- USB cable (already owned)
- miscellaneous tools from around the house

Steps:
1. While waiting for the parts to ship, I will learn to use CAD software and model a case
2. Assemble and set up the 3D-printer
3. Print the case
4. Solder the components
5. Program the Arduino
6. Test the setup
7. Mount the components to the case
8. Never have a dry room again!
