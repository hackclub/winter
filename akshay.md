# Plant Disease Detection Rove

Expected Result From The Rover

## Summary

- I'm going to build a Raspeberry pi based Rover. The rover will use computer vision to analyze the visual input from its surroundings and detect several plant diseases.
It will also track plant growth and store the data in a database for further analysis.

- The rover will be powered by a Raspberry Pi, a single-board computer that is popular among DIY enthusiasts and professionals alike for its small size, low power consumption, and high processing power.

- The rover's computer vision capabilities will allow it to identify and diagnose various plant diseases, which can help farmers and gardeners take timely and appropriate action to prevent the spread of these diseases and protect their crops.
Additionally, the rover's plant growth tracking feature will enable users to monitor the health and development of their plants and make informed decisions about their care and maintenance.

- this project has the potential to revolutionize the way we detect and manage plant diseases, and it could have a significant impact on the agriculture industry.
## Plan

For the first 5 days, I will focus solely on writing code and setting up the database. This will involve working diligently to ensure that the software is functional and the database is properly configured.

After the initial 5 days, I will have a maximum of 24 hours to design the circuit for the rover. This will involve creating a detailed plan for the layout and functionality of the circuit, as well as sourcing the necessary components and materials.

Once the circuit design is complete, I can begin assembling the rover. This will involve building the physical components of the rover, including the circuit and the Raspberry Pi, and ensuring that everything is working together smoothly.

Finally, I will train the model using a variety of plant images, so that it can accurately identify and diagnose various plant diseases. This will be a critical step in getting my rover ready for use in the field.
