# Home automation

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?
Home automation is an increasingly important part of connected house. It makes daily life easier by automatically performing small and simple tasks. Unfortunately, the various brands on the market generally only offer expensive and not very flexible product range. i want to work on a solution which makes home automation accessible to all by using a raspberry pi, ESP32 and some sensors and actuators.

## Plan

firstly i plan on developing a centralautomation hub using rasberry pi and apache server for web based manipulation later i plan to integrate it with alexa or google ai as per need


i want to  develop different modules such as:

Control camera
 unit for water tank  weather level ant to check its lid status
Lighting management
Heating management
Pet food management
 Remotely controlled electric shutters.
 Gas detection module- in the kitchen
 they all wil make use of esp 32 boards
 boards vwill be reused for newer modles as the modules are more compared to the esp boards the modules are more.
 
 modules can be increased or decresed as per need,time  and avaibility of hardware components and further modules can be easily added in the future.
 they will be connected o the central hub built using rasberry pi and can be accessed through web for now and can be manipulated theough mobile phones in the future.
 
 As all the codes are open-source, to enable me to appropriate the modules in future.
 
 i will be refrancing the following builds-

ApTechDeals 60W /100 Watt Dual Watt Glue Gun will be used to bulid the box for the pet food  odule i aleady have the wood available with me.
GLUN 11 mm Transparent HOT MELT glue sticks will be put in the glue gun



 D10 3.7V Rechargeable Lithium ion Battery Power Bank Cell  X 3 will be conndected to the esp 32 modules
