# Pixel Box

## Summary

While I was listening to Spotify, I suddenly got an idea to build a Pixel Box- Smart Digital Picture Frame that dispaly picture as Pixel using PI Zero W.
## Plan

Firstly, I will try out some tutorials on the internet. After I learned, how to use all the tools, I will start to create Pixel Box. I will use https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-PI-Pixel-Art-Animation-Display/ for the project guideline. Since, I don't have the 3d printer, I will handcraft the frame with cardboard.

## Budget

I choose to order Vilros Raspberry Pi Zero W Complete Starter Kit With Non Solder Header( Free shipping ) instead of pre solder kit because I want to try soldering. In the items, there is also a 5v 10 A power supply in the list because the power supply that included in the kit is just 5v 2.5A.
