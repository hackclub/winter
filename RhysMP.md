# DonkeyCar RC car

## Summary

I plan on building a RC car which can  drive itself and also be controlled from mobile. I'm super excited as I have always wanted to experiemnt with a rasberry pi and see what amazing things I could do with it. I also have always thought RC cars were fasinating. 

## Plan

First I will order all of the products. 

Then I will send all the CAD files required for this car to my HS's Physics teacher to 3D print using the makerbots we have on campus.

I will then clean up all of these prints.

I will attach the parts together. (Pi > 3d printed plate) (Camera to Adatper)

Then I will install the Donkeycare software and configure it all.
