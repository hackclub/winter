# Portable FM radio Staion

## Summary
I have planned to build a Portable FM Radio Station that will be able to broadcast 
the audio signals from the microphone and will be able to play custom sound as well.
This radio station will be capable of broadcasting an FM radio signal over a small area,
and can be taken on the go or set up at events. I am excited about this project because
it can be set up anywhere as it is portable and moreover I will get to know about how 
the FM Radio Station works.


## Plan

First things first, I will do it to power the Raspberry Pi through micro USB cable using a powerbank, 
as it will be the brain of the radio station.Then,I will set up Raspberry Pi OS and then clone a 
script for broadcasting the audio from the microphone. 
Script link: https://github.com/markondej/fm_transmitter 
GPIO pin 4 of Raspberry Pi is used by the software to emit the signals. I have a jumper wire for the
antenna whose one end will be connected to the pin and the other end wired up in the Antenna's end.
I will run the script which will transmit audio through
the antenna received as input from the USB audio adapter. Then I will require a 
microphone headset to transmit live audio. After that I will be using 
a micro HDMI cable to connect the pi to the monitor then I will connect it to internet and install the 
software of the FM station. I will broadcast the audio through the FM station and test the station by
receiving the signal through an FM radio Speaker. We will be able to play the audio at custom frequency 
and the FM radio speaker can pick those signals and play via speakers or even an FM Radio enabled 
smartphone can be used for that. If everything is working fine, then I will make custom 
cardboard enclosure for the radio station and wrap all the tools in single unit.
