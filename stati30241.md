# Hexapod

## Summary

I plan to build a simple hexapod robot that is capable of walking around. The hexapod is going to be controlled by an Esp32, and will have 18 standard
motors to move around. The motors are going to be controlled by two servo drivers. The body of the robot will all be 3d printed, and all the parts will be designed by me.
I will use M4 nuts and bolts along with some bearings to connect everything. To power the robot, I will be using 18650 batteries, and all the code will be written by me.
I also plan to integrate an MPU-6050 module so the robot is able to balance itself. I am not following any tutorial and I intend to design and build this all by myself,
however I will be taking some inspiration from these videos:

I want to work on this project since this will be my first time working with legged robots and I have always wanted to dive into this subject. The programming is also
something that I am excited about since I will have to implement forward and inverse kinematics, which sound really fun.

## Plan

1. Collect all the parts I need
2. Sketch out the idea of the robot
3. Test out the electronics and write some prototype code
4. Design all the 3d printed parts in Fusion 360 and print them out
5. Test fit and find any problems that need fixing
6. Redesign parts and test again
7. Repeat until satisfied
8. Assemble everything and connect all the electronics
9. Write the final code
10. Test everything, fix problems, and repeat until everything works properly
11. The project is now complete
