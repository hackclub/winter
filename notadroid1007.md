# Eye Safe Pocket Blogger

## Summary

I love to write books, and blogs. How ever spending so much time in front of a screen that emits blue rays, is extremly harmful
for our sensitive eyes. This brings a block in out writing journey, and several times inturups our flow of thoughts. So I have
come up with a very good idea. A kindle has an E-Ink screen, that used magnetic ink to display things on a screen. 
This kind of screen also comes in multi color versions, that look amazing. So the idea is to make a mini computer with RasberryPi
as the heart of the system, and a 5.7" 7 color E-Ink display, along with an amazing looking case, perfect for you to carry 
with you for any journey you want to make. IT can be tiled to any angle you want for comfort, and several cases for customizability.
It will also have a camera to record moments that you wish to remember on any trip.
It will have a mic so you can record audio blogs, and a mini computer so you never have to worry about space.
It will be powered by Lithium Ion cells, so you get a good power backup.
It aims to make taking notes, vlogs, blogs, audio blogs, and writing stories very easy, and less strainful to your eyes.

## Plan

The plan is somewhat like this:
1. Order the RasberryPi, display, mic, camera, battries(with charging and safety modules), the mini keyboard, and get acrylic sheets for the case.
2. Assemble all the parts, and maybe make a few custom programs for the pi in python to make it looks good.
3. Make the case in 3 dirrent colors.
4. Fix the leds in the case to make it look good.
5. Mount all the parts like the lcd, the mic, camera etc to the case.
6. Make the battery module with the charger and safety modules.
7. fix the battries and close the case with openable cool looking HDD screws.
