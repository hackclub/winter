# 3d printer upgrades

## Summary

I am going to build a resin curing station and upgrade my Ender 3 V2 with auto bed leveling and install a raspberry pi to run octoprint. This will allow me to cure my resin prints quicker and more reliably, remotely control my Ender 3 while gathering and observing lots of data that I can use to monitor and improve my prints. I aim to learn how to get octoprint running and efficently and reliably manage my 3d prints. 

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

## Plan

1. 3d print an enclosure for the Raspberry Pi. 
2. Install Octoprint on it.
3. Install the Auto bed level.
4. Drill a hole in the paint can route the UV light strip through.
5. Apply the UV light strip to the sides of the paint can.
6. Place the solar turntable inside. 

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
