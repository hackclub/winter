# Multi-Function Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

I'm going to build a custom 60% mechanical keyboard that can control my room and assist in productivity (in addition to acting as a keyboard). I will also make a custom coiled USB cable for the keyboard. Special functions of the keyboard would include:
- Custom textured/designed 3D-printed keycaps for certain specified keys (e.g. a calico cat sticking out of the shift key would be very cute!)
- Control the RGB lights in my room with specific key combos
- Custom-coded "modes"
  - "Study Mode" -- the keyboard stops working on certain websites/apps for a certain amount of time (+ backlights on keyboard could act as a pomodoro timer)
  - "Ghost Mode" -- when I activate this mode, the keyboard will start ghost-typing random words (could be really funny to let someone borrow the keyboard to write an essay ... and then it suddenly starts inserting random words!)

Goals:
- Gain familiarity with CAD and 3D-printing
- Learn how to solder
- Learn how to make a functioning cable
- Explore the intersection between software & hardware to create smart-room controls + code keyboard modes

## Plan

Pt. 1 Keyboard:
1. Gain familiarity with Fusion360 via online tutorials
2. 3D-design  keycaps (with 3D texture/design) for W, A, S, D keys + F, J keys + Numeric Row to allow for more accessible typing experience (the non-customized keycaps will be purchased)
3. 3D-print keycaps using school's or friend's 3D-printer
4. Paint keycaps using paint + add some type of acrylic sealer to make sure paint doesnt chip + increase aesthetics
5. Cut foam for sound dampening
6. Lube switches & stabilizers
7. Assemble switches & remaining keyboard components
8. Create keyboard firmware with Vial
9. Flash smart plug (connected to my room's RGB lights) with open source Tasmota firmware for local control
10. Use AutoHotkey to code scripts to create automation / shortcuts (not 100% this will work; may use a different method)

Pt. 2 Cable:
1. Sleeve cable with paracord sheath & secure PET sleeve using hair dryer or lighter
2. Coil cable around metal rod + apply heat
3. Strip cable tips using wire stripper
4. Strip the 4 inner wire tips to reveal metal tips
5. Solder USB connectors onto the cable
6. Install heat shrinks
7. Reverse coil using tape & metal rod
