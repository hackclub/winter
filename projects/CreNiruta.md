# Project Name
IOT Display Device
## Summary

I am going to build and IOT based Display Device that can fetch data from internet and feed to the display device live.For Example, Viewing Youtube Subscribers, Stock Market Prices etc.

## Plan
First of all, I will use an API to fetch the JSON data and then after the JSON is returned I will display it to the Display Device. 
For Example, If I am to disply the Subscriber Count then I can use GoogleAPI and then fetch the JSON to display into the display device.
Secondly, I would also like to experiment the display device with the Raspberry PI so I can get more creative with the Display Content inside the Display Device.
Thirdly, I would also like to try combining the displays together to get some kind of sync extended display.
## Budget

The Materials that I own are:
Raspberry PI
Arduino UNO
USB A Cable
Jumper Wires
Breadboard
Soldering Iron and other basic components.
