# Telegraph

## Summary

My plan is to build a telegraph system, which like the original telegraph by Samuel Morse, would be outputting a message on a display once a user inputs their message in morse code. I'm excited to build it because the telegraph is one of the inventions in history that I'm most interested in! I love researching forms of communication and cryptography's evolution over the years. 


## Plan

Beginning, I simply want to get the message outputted onto the screen. However, if time allows for it, I want to make it able to communicate across several systems. I would be 3D printing first with the STL file available of Samuel Morse's telegraph, https://3d.si.edu/object/3d/morse-vail-telegraph-key%3Aed99f44d-3c60-4111-b666-e2908e1b64ef. Later, I'd be wiring the Arduino and LCD display together to code the software which registers the morse code from the button clicks. I'd be using the Arduino IDE. 

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
