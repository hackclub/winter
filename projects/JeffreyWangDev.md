# The light cube

## Summary

My project will be a 3d light cube controlled by a raspberry pi. The light cube will be 8 by 8 by 8 pixels and will be made of WS2811 round LEDs. After the construction of the main cube, I want to write a web interface for it in python/Django. I'm exited by this project as it allows me to put my programming skills and electrical skills to a real word test and not just in a classroom setting.  
## Plan

Im going to follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciaFar8nfHc
) guild-ish mostly (not for all)

## Build phase
  1. Get materials
  2. Design and 3D print parts/jigs
  3. Bend/test all 512 LEDS and replace all the broken ones
  4. Start the long soldering process 
  5. End of the Build phase

## Software phase
  1. Design a backend to control the LEDS with FastLeds and mysql database for queuing in python 
  2. Design a backend API in django/flask to send queuies to a mysql database
  3. Design frontend in html/css/js 
  4. Debug all errors
  5. If time, create diffrent algorithms for different function ect wave, sin, cosin, sync with...
  6. If more time, create a IOS app to control all of this

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
