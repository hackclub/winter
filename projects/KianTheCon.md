# Monopoly Tablet

## Summary

I am going to build a tablet designed to be mounted to a table so that one can play a digital version of the board game Monopoly on it. It will utilize pieces with special shapes of conductive pads on the bottom (as indicated in this instructable https://www.instructables.com/Object-Interaction-With-Touchscreens) to differentiate the specific pieces, allowing for more specialized semi-physical UI interactions (differentiating which player is moving, letting players move their pieces in a more fun/entertaining way, etc). In the long run, I envision having online play capabilities and possibly other board games (but that is way too ambitious for a short hackathon so I am keeping it simple for now).

## Plan

First, I will first be following more or less this instructable (https://www.instructables.com/Object-Interaction-With-Touchscreens/) in order to set up several prototype game pieces. I will paint some felt pads with conductive filament and attach them to some metal game pieces I already have (or some similar conductive object if that doesn't work).

Second, I will hook up a 7" LCD Display to a NucBox S SBC (I realize that this may seem overkill for this project, but given that I could've payed a similar price for something less powerful than a raspberry pi with the way the pricing is gouged at the moment, I though it would be more appropriate to try and get something that had a better value) in order to create the tablet device that will allow my special game pieces to be utilized.

Finally, I will program a Monopoly port that utilizes my different shaped pieces, hopefully creating an interesting digital/physical board game fusion that puts a unique spin on the classic game. 

## Budget

Note: I'm aware this goes a few dollars over budget but I am willing to  pay the excess myself if that is possible.
