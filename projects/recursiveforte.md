# Damien Invasion

## Summary

With a friend, I'm building a combinatinon of an art piece and a space-invaders-style arcade console thing, which we'll try to put in a coffee shop or something somewhere. It'll consist of a 4x4 matrix of RGB LED matrix panels behind a painting on a canvas. We're planning for the game to be playable using one or more phones as controllers, with planned multiplayer and saved, personalized game stats. It'll hopefully provide something fun for people to play and congregate over, like pokemon go but a ton more cool and expensive.

## Plan

1. Buy the stuff
2. Get the stuff
3. Make some stuff (3d print enclosure, pixel seperator grids)
4. Use the stuff that we made to make more stuff (install led matrix panels, fit into canvas, make sure it's working)
5. Make different stuff at the same time (paint on the canvas to provide a scene for when the game is off and to fit into it while it's on)
6. Make more stuff, but with code (create a simple game, figure out how to control the thing with phones either through Bluetooth or the internet)
7. Make even more stuff, with even more code (work on the game to make it actually playable & enjoyable)
8. Install the stuff that was just made, somewhere, somehow
