# smart music system

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

i plan to build  a smart music system using rasbery pi , speaker parts and amplifiers, balena sound software , will later be
integrated with google voice assistant using linear mic array on rasberry pi. I feel excited music systems have been made using raspi but voice enabled ones have
never been tried before. I want integrate it into a single system.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

1) central hub using rasberry pi- 
will be our main blutooth and wireles module. will recieve signals from devices and send it to speakers using aux cables. will also be integrated with ai based assistant like alexa / google ai to give us the capablity of a smart speaker

will make use of the following parts-
already owened-
1 x 4500 mah li-ion battery - to be removed from the mobile phone i already own, -will be connected to rasberry pi , will act as energy source
1 aux cable - already owened - to connect the raspi module to our speaker module
parts to buy-
1 x Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 2 GB RAM- main computing circut which will connect to bluetooth and host ai assisrtant in the future
1 x Sipeed MAIX R6+1 Microphone Array- mic and ai circut enabling us to run real time conversations as ai assistants do
1 x ShivExim 25 in 1 Precision Screwdriver Set Multi Pocket Repair Tool Kit  will be used to remove the battery from my phone to connect to the ras-pi
1 x microsd card - to store the necesssary software already owened.

2) 
1 x Jbl Cs790Chi 390W Wired Woofer Black- speaker tweeter set to output low frequency and high frequency audio. 
1 x Passive Bass Radiator (Pack of 2)- to maintain the bass in our speaker
1 x speaker wires- connecting the electronic components together. 1 x 150 Mm PVC Pipe - owened- will act as the body of our speaker.
1 x Tufkote Vinyl Film Decal 3D carbon Fiber Twill-Weave Matte Design, Size 24 X 12 Inches (Black) - will be usedcd to cover the pvcpipe
1 x cutting tool -(hacksaw )p- to cut the pvc pipe as needed
1 x glue gun - joining together the parts of the
1 x soldering machine- purpose of soldering
1 x Audio Jack â€“ 3.5mm TRRS (SMD), will be connected to aux cable from raspi module
1 x TPA3116D2 12 to 24V DC Dual Channel 2 x 80W Audio Power Amplifier,amplifier board
1 x Bluetooth 4.0 CSR8645 Amplifier Board 5W+5W APT-X Stereo Receiver Amp Module- will enable the speaker to work wirelessly
1 x Ambrane Lithium Polymer Stylo Max 50000mAh Power Bank - Blue- i plan on using this as my batterey as it makes use of li poly battries and gives same voltage as normal li-poly battries do yet is cheaper and offers more charging ports, power  and same voltage.
2 x 2 x YLY-2088 400W Treble-Bass Crossover Dual 2-Way Speaker Audio Crossover Module- crosssovers used in speakers will connect the speakers and amplifiers together
