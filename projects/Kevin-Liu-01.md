# Project Name
SplintTech - Revolutionizing Recovery

## Summary

For this project, I am going to build "SplintTech," a 3D printed finger splint that will prevent the range of motion of a finger while it is healing from either a chronic condition or injury/break. 

SplintTech aims to provide users with a reliable, comfortable, and easy-to-use splint that helps them recover from finger injuries. The splints will be  designed using Fusion 360 and will be printed using high-quality PLA plastic material. They can be customized to fit the specific needs of individual users, and thus provide an affordable and reproducible alternative to store-purchased splints that can be either rare or pricey. The goal of SplintTech is to help people recover from finger injuries more quickly and effectively, and to provide them with a high-quality splint that meets their needs.

3D printing technology would be a good option for creating finger splints because it allows for the creation of customized, high-quality splints that are tailored to the specific needs of individual users. 3D printing technology also enables the creation of splints with complex shapes and fine details, which may not be possible using traditional manufacturing methods.

Another advantage of using 3D printing for finger splints is that it allows for the creation of splints on demand, without the need for large-scale production. This can be particularly useful in situations where there is a high demand for splints, or where it is important to be able to quickly produce splints for specific users.

Finally, 3D printing technology can be a cost-effective option for creating finger splints, particularly when compared to traditional manufacturing methods. This can make it an attractive option for organizations or individuals who are looking to produce splints in a cost-effective way.

I am excited to build this project because I believe that by developing a functional, comfortable splint, I can help people recover more quickly and effectively, and improve their quality of life. I am also excited to explore the technical challenges of building a device like this, and to learn 
more about the possibilities of using 3D printing for medical applications. Additionally, if this works, it would be a proof of concept for an ultra-cheap 
splint made of plastic that would not only be more comfortable but more accessible as well.

## Plan

1. Design: Design the hand in Fusion 360 to create a detailed 3D model of the splint, including all the parts and components. I will use
scientific literature to ensure my design is sound. As such, I will consider the size and shape of the finger, as well as the types of movements and tasks it will need to be able to perform.

2. 3D print the parts: Use a 3D printer to print all the parts for the splint. To fit on the finger, it will essentially be a shell splint into two parts - one on top of the finger and one below, on the fingerpads. Appropriate settings and procedures will be used to achieve the desired results.

3. Assemble the splint: Once the parts are printed, they will be attached together. Additionally, parts like string can be used to allow the user to freely adjust the splint's tightness as desired. This will allow customizability in the sense that it can be adjusted to fit different sized or shaped fingers. I will use a 3d print finishing kit to adjust certain parts and create certain shapes as necessary.

4. Testing: Once the splint  is assembled, I will test it to make sure all the parts are working correctly and that the hand is able to perform the desired tasks. 
This may involve picking up items and ensuring it does not get in the way or impair normal movements. I will use the 3d print finishing kit with sandpaper to sand and smooth off parts as necessary.

5. Fine-tune and refine: As I test and use the splint, I will most likely need to make adjustments and refinements to the design and code to make it more 
effective and reliable. I will be able to use my own hand for testing. I am prepared to iterate and improve the splint as I go.

Originally, I considered outsourcing the 3D printing to a 3rd party company, but as I began brainstorming I realized that this would be too inefficient for my project.

I would have little to no control over the printing process and would not be able to make changes and adjustments as needed. This is particularly unfortunate for 
prototyping and testing multiple designs or making quick changes on the fly. I can only begin designing and testing a new iteration when the company is ready,
forcing me to wait for the new design to arrive any time I make any design change, which is contrary to rapid prototyping and would most likely go over the 10 days
I would have for this project. On top of that, I would have to pay for the shipping, (potentially) the plastic, and a whole bunch of other costs, like service fees, 
and I would not be able to present these costs upfront (a stipulation for a grant).

As such, because it was in my  combined budget, I decided to buy a 3D printer and filament instead. It may take some time out of the 10 days to assemble, 
but it will save me a lot of time in the prototyping and testing cycle. It will ultimately save me an extremely valuable amount of time in the development process 
and allow me to quickly prototype and test different hand designs.
