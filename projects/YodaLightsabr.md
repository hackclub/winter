# Smart Alarm Clock

## Summary

This smart alarm clock will use a Raspberry PI, 7 inch display, and a physical button. Here's what it'll do:

* Display time
* Show weather
* Show calendar events
* Control smart home devices with Homebridge
* Set alarms

## Plan

After getting materials, I plan to wire up the button, RPi, and display to build the clock. Then I'll measure it and 3D-print a case that can go on my nightstand. I'll program the display with React and use Chromium in kiosk mode to render it. I'll use Nodejs to handle the button with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins and control which data is being displayed.

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
