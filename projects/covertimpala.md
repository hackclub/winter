# VR glove

## Summary

This VR glove will track finger motion and rotation of the hand by using an accelerometer, magnetometer, gyro (which are all included in the Feather nRF52840) and 5 hall effect sensors. The glove will also have 5 vibrational motors on each fingertip in order to allow the user to feel objects in VR.

## Plan

1) Design and 3D print parts
2) First step will be to prepare parts by soldering pins onto them and start to create the basic software which will allow me to test sensors.
3) Next, sensors will be wired to controllerboards and software connecting the glove and computer via bluetooth will be created.
4) More tests and troubleshooting will happen at this stage as well as more accurate tracking systems are developed.
5) Drivers are built in order to make the device VR compatable.
