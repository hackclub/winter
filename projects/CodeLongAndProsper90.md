# Out Of Time - The Hacker's CLock

## Summary
This is going to be a smart clock, with the following features:
- time and date
- analog and digital display modes
- plays music from sd card as an alarm
- can store multiple alarms, and schedule them.

Possible features
- reads metadata from WAV file
- displays messages on birthdays and holidays (needs a big database though)
- gets weather report from outside unit (needs chips, license, $$$)
- plays video games (input problem)

I currently have a sony alarm clock but the local radio stations are :poop:, so I want to make a better alarm clock

## Plan
I plan to first breadboard this, without any sort of external input sans serial.
First I'm going to figure out the ui in p5.js / turtle to get an idea of what I need to do. Next, I'll make the audio amp and player.
Next would be the display / ui, should be pretty fast.
Once I get audio output working, I'm going to design a faceplate for the display and controls. After that I think I'll make the rest of the case then solder.
I might use plexiglass, or 3d print, depending on cost. (I'll probably pay for that)
Then I'll test one more time then solder, case up and go from there.
