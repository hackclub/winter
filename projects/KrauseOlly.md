# FPV Go Kart

## Summary
I plan on building a camera system that will be able to record and broadcast (using analog fpv equipment) back to spectators so they can watch the sport live from various views
## Plan

Order Parts, Design a camera housing on fusion 360, Print, Test various camera angles and minimize vibrations, Record and analyse footage

## Budget
All prices are in USD, I already have some parts, I will also be contributing ontop of the $250 grant as this is somthing I'm passionate about.
