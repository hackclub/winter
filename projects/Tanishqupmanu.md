# Project Name
Navigation Drone
 I am Tanishq Upmanu working with my friend @Sameer Yasin / Sam 

## Summary with Plan
Building a drone, or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), can be a thrilling and educative experience. It requires a combination of engineering, design, and programming skills, and the goal is to create a device that can perform a variety of tasks, depending on its design and purpose. The drone, typically controlled remotely by a pilot or through a pre-programmed flight path, can be used for a wide range of purposes, including surveillance, photography, mapping, delivery, and scientific research.

To build a drone, the first step is to gather all the necessary parts and tools for assembling the device. This includes the main body of the drone, the propellers, motors, battery, and any additional components that are specific to the particular drone model. Additionally, one will need a few tools, such as a screwdriver and a pair of pliers.

Next, we will be 3D printing the parts that I created in Fusion 360. With all the necessary parts and tools on hand, we will begin the assembly process. First, the motors will be attached to the body of the drone. Each motor is connected to a specific arm of the drone, and we will use screws or bolts to secure them in place. We will make sure that the motors are securely fastened, as they will be responsible for lifting the drone off the ground.

After the motors are attached, we will attach the propellers to the motors. The propellers have a specific orientation, and we will make sure that they are facing the correct direction. We can usually tell which way the propellers should face by looking for a small arrow or line on the base of the propeller.

With the propellers in place, we will install the battery and any additional electronics, such as a flight controller or GPS module. We will make sure that all of these components are securely fastened and properly connected to the main body of the drone.

Finally, we will test the drone to ensure that everything is working correctly. This will involve turning on the drone and using a remote control to move it through the air. If everything seems to be working properly, we can start using our drone for flights.

In conclusion, building a drone presents an exciting opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to create a device that can perform a wide range of tasks and functions. The prospect of designing and building a machine that can fly and perform various tasks is incredibly rewarding, and I am excited to be a part of this process.This drone is a successor to the previous drone that was presented at EPOCH India. It boasts a range of new, advanced features and is equipped with an array of sensors that enable it to perform a variety of tasks. Additionally, it has been designed with an emphasis on safety, making it a reliable and secure choice for various applications.
