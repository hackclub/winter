 # USB HID Glove
 
 ## Summary
Glove modifified with electronics, hopefully mounted in glove, to allow user to interact with computer  
Will interact based on finger position, hand speed and hand acceleration, allowing for gesture movement  
Will connect to computer via (kinda) wireless USB plugin

## Plan
Day 1 will involve basic wiring on breadboards. Day 2 - 4 will be soldering to each other. Days 5 - 8 will be basic coding of glove and computer interaction. 9 & 10 will be for tuning.
