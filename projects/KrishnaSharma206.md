# Object Recognition Warehouse Robot

## Summary

A robot that recohnizes certain shapes and navigates it's way accordingly, I am going to build this robot because I liked the idea of the amazon warehouse robot and the projects made by a guy named James Bruton, and I really wanna learn about object recognition through this project. I already have some experience making robots using arduino, so it will be something new for me.

## Plan

I will be using the jetson nano as the brain of this project, the raspberry pi wont be enough for this and the jetson nano will be a better alternative
, I will be using a camera for the detection and I am planning to add more sensors and actuators to it in the future(like a beanbag gripper arm).

The Steps:
1. Learn how to use the jetson nano
2. Connect my laptop to the jetson nano using a vnc
3. Train the AI model on the jetson nano using basic shapes for easier recognition
4. Build the robot, then program the robot using python
5. Test the robot.

Note: I have mentioned everything I need for the robot, I have an old chassis which used for an arduino project, so I can use that again
