# IRL Pong

## Summary

I am planning to be building a Pong board with a physical ball and paddles. It will be a lot like normal Pong, but with a new way to experience it. I am excited to build it because I live by a place called Pinball Jones, and there I found a Pong game a lot like it.

## Plan

I won't need many tools other than my 3D printer, and wood working tools in my garage.
I will make simple files for the controls (just little wheels).
The software will just control the paddles and ball, along with taking in input. I have made a JavaScript version of pong, so I believe it wouldn't be too hard to port that code to this project.

1. First, I will make a simple board, likely just smooth wood. (around 1 day)
2. Then, I will build a simple gantry to move a magnet around underneath the board. (with wiring, probably 2 days)
3. After that I will get simple balls and paddles with magnets inside (around 1/2 day)
4. Then, it's just the software, then I will be done.
