# Home automation

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?
Home automation is an increasingly important part of connected house. It makes daily life easier by automatically performing small and simple tasks. Unfortunately, the various brands on the market generally only offer expensive and not very flexible product range. i want to work on a solution which makes home automation accessible to all by using a raspberry pi, ESP32 and some sensors and actuators.

## Plan

1) centralautomation hub using rasberry pi and apache server -first inplan to develope a central  hub using rasberry pi and apache server  which will connect to the other modules over the web using wifi and esp 32 boards
- will make use of -
1 x |RPI4-MODBP-8GB|-the main rasberry pi board.
1 x | Orange Raspberry Pi 4 Advance Kit   |- will be used to set up rasaberry pi, provide it with necessary power and connect it with the software and wifi, 
1 x | 40 Pin Red GPIO Extension Board for Raspberry Pi|- will enable me to easily connect the parts from rasbrerry pi kit on the board without harming the rasberry pi board

they all wil make use of esp 32 boards
 boards vwill be reused for newer modles as the modules are more compared to the esp boards the modules are more.
 
 modules can be increased or decresed as per need,time  and avaibility of hardware components and further modules can be easily added in the future.
 they will be connected o the central hub built using rasberry pi and can be accessed through web for now and can be manipulated theough mobile phones in the future.
 
 As all the codes are open-source, to enable me to appropriate the modules in future.
 
 i will be refrancing the following builds-
 1)  https://www.instructables.com/Free-Smart-Home/
 2)  https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-Pi-Home-Automation-Control-lights-comput/
 3)  https://www.instructables.com/Home-Automation-4-5-6/
 4)  https://www.instructables.com/Smart-Home-by-Raspberry-Pi/
 5)  https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Cheap-Safety-Alarm-System-W-Raspberry-a-Smarte/
 
the following parts will be used again and again: throughout the building procdess:
a)|Plusivo Soldering Kit with Multimeter (EU Plug) | - soldering the wires into boards , the sensors to esp 32 modules and sensors together also will be used to do the process of removing soldring
b)| Orange Raspberry Pi 4 Advance Kit   |  mainly used in the central automation hub but can also be used for other modules.
c)| 20 CM 40 Pin Dupont Cable Male/Male, Male/Female, Female/Female Cable Combo |- the wires to be used theoughout the module
d)| Tactile Push Button Switch set | buttons to be used in the esp 32 module enabled circuts
e)| GLUN 11 mm Transparent HOT MELT glue sticks - to be used in the hot glue gun.
f) cardboard and plywood sheets/pieces- already owned:- creating containers for the modules and the wooden bin in petbfood module.
g)| ApTechDeals 60W /100 Watt Dual Watt Glue Gun |- glueing together the wooden and cardboatrd pieces and cases.
