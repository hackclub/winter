# Hack Club Bank Sign

## Summary

I'm going to build a sign at Hack Club HQ that changes color based on user input through a web app. I'm excited to build it because Hack Club currently doesn't have a sign, and I think it would be a nice addition to the Town of Shelburne.

## Plan

For the first 4 days, I'm going write a web app and API for people to change the color of the an LED. I will also make a small prototype of the sign using a breadboard, wires, microcontroller, LEDs, and some laser-cut scrap material. For the following 6 days, I'm going to make the full size sign using the 32x32 RGB LED matrix, aluminum sheet, and acrylic.
