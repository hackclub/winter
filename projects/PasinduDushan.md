# Arduino CNC Plotter Machine with a Custom Dashboard

![Untitled design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57533877/208594271-1b8ddf98-3816-490b-a075-2d8430bab6b2.gif)

## Summary

I'm going to build a arduino CNC plotter machine. This machine will be made with 2 CD/DVD writers, arduino uno board, motor shileld driver and a lcd display. LCD Display can be used to identify the item currently drawing and the status of the drawing. I won't be following any guides when building this plotter machine because I have a good knowledge of arduino and I believe trying is the best thing. Also I'll build a custom dashboard to convert images to the machine understandable code because it's very hard for someone to do it if a user does not have some knowledge about g-code. This will be a nice project for me because I can make the machine to draw very beautiful images.

## Plan

1. Collect all the parts I need to make this project.
2. De-Assemble CD/DVD writers and remove unnecessary parts. (CD/DVD Scanner)
3. Make a Pen Holder with the servo motor.
4. Connect wires to the CD/DVD writers and also to the servo motor.
5. Connect Arduino with the Motor Shield and then connect all the wires coming from motors and servo.
6. Assemble all items (CD/DVD Driver, Pen Holder and Arduino Board). After that connect the LCD Display to the machine which can be used to show the item currently drawing and show the stats of the drawing. (Ex:- How many percentages of the drawing has completed.)
7. Program the machine with arduino IDE to verify if everything is working as expected.
8. Program the web dashboard which can be used to convert normal images to machine understandable code. (This is a 2 software process made into 1)
9. Prepare the machine for the first testrun by using inkspace software and makerboard G-code to generate a g-code for the image and then run the machine. (First I'm    going to use the software and then test the dashboard)
10. Test the custom made dashboard by running the machine again using the dashboard generated g-code.
11. Complete the project if everything work as expected.

## 2nd Proposal

# Advance Heart Rate Monitoring System With A Custom Built Alert System

## Summary

This is my 2nd project proposal because the 1st project proposal only take $100 from the grant and I thought of making another project with the remaining $150. I'll be making an advance heart beat monitoring system which will be a really nice project for me. There are a lot of tutorials out in the internet about making heart beat monitoring systems but mine will be slightly different. As my system will have a custom built alert system which will alert the phone with a notification if the heart beat increases (NodeMCU Module can be used to notify.). I'm using a NodeMCU here because it provides great functionalities that Arduino UNO can't, Such as sending notifications also NodeMCU can be really helpful to exchange information between the system and a smart phone. If I want to create a user interface with the data of the heart rate sensor I can do it by getting data from NodeMCU. Arduino UNO will be used to process the data coming from the sensor and display it. Heart Beat will be displayed in a really nice beautiful display with graphs and also this system can be used from anywhere in the world. This project will be really useful for people who have unwell people in the home. I won't be following any tutorials because I have a good knowledge about Arduino and NodeMCU. 

## Plan

1. Collect all the parts I need to make this project.
2. Check all the parts before getting started. (NodeMCU and TFT Display)
3. Assemble the heart rate sensor and arduino to do a test run to calibrate the sensor. Display won't be a necessary part in this step as I'll be using the serial monitor in Arduino IDE.
4. Assemble the heart rate sensor and TFT display and check whether the display is showing correct data according to the serial monitor.
5. Connect the NodeMCU with the Arduino board.
6. Connect the NodeMCU module with the Mobile Phone.
7. Do a test notification using the NodeMCU.
8. Make a Box out of Cardboard to hold all the parts inside with the battery connector. (Except for the heartbeat sensor.)
9. If everything is working fine assemble all the parts together and do the final checks.
10. Complete the project.
