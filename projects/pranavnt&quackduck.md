# FSC (full self cycling Bike 

## Summary

Ishan and I are building an ebike that has full self cycling â€“ you can press a button (on touchscreen) and it will cruise at ~8mph on a trail, detecting lanes and the side of the trail, and automatically steer.

## Plan

1) Put battery on top rack; surround with pre-owned foam and duct tape 
2) Mount the Motor & ESC such that the motor moving will move the chain
3) Mount training wheels
4) Mount the touchscreen, servo that controls the steering, and OAK-D Camera. Tie string to handlebars.
5) Connect the Raspberry Pi to the ESC, Touchscreen, servo, and OAK-D Camera
6) Run self driving software

Self-driving software will work by detecting the lane and edge of a trail using a pre-trained lane detection model. Based on this, we'll model how much the bike has to turn. Max speed in this mode will be ~8mph probably. String will be connected to a servo and each of the handles; turning will be adjusting the string.

## Budget
