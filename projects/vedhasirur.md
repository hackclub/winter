# Project Name
Water Level Monitoring System

## Summary

I am going to build a water level monitoring system with the Blynk app. 
It uses ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the water level and displays it on the screen.
I am excited to build it as it will be my first hardware project.


## Plan
I will first start by connecting the LED bulbs to the Nodemcu board. 
I will then connect LCD screen, ultrasonic sensor, and relay module to the Nodemcu board as seen on the circut diagram.
Lastly, I will set up the app and connect Nodemcu board to the computer and upload the program for this system.
