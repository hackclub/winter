# Wireless XM1

## Summary

I plan to build a 3D-printed wireless mouse based on the shape of the XM1 using the internals from the G305 with a few changes of my own.  
This mouse will have the ability to recharge so I do not have to disassemble the mouse every time the battery dies. Additionally, instead of 
the standard Omron switches the G305 comes with I will be replacing them with Kailh GM 4.0s to have a crisper and more tactile feeling mouse switch. 
I am excited to build this gaming mouse because I want to try many things within the realm of gaming mice that I haven't been able to try before, like 
the XM1 shape and GM 4.0s switches, due to a lack of funds. Furthermore, I always wanted to get into 3D printing to gain more insight into what engineering 
is all about through the usage of creating 3D models for projects. Furthermore, the process of building this 3D-printed wireless gaming mouse will be 
more complex than prior projects and I am excited to venture into the unknown and succeed at my goal. 

## Plan

The first step in creating the wireless mouse is to find a tutorial on how to create a 3D model of the XM1 that works with G305 internals.
This step should be somewhat easy as the G305 internals are commonly used for 3D-printed mice. The next step would be to find youtube videos 
on the most optimal settings for the Tronxy Crux1 so that the 3D-printed parts come out as nicely as possible. The third step would be to begin 
the process of 3D printing the mouse parts to assemble them later on. While the parts are printing I would move on to the fourth step which is 
to take out the soldering kit that I have and desolder the Omrons in the G305 and replace them by soldering in the Kailh GM 4.0s for better MB1 and MB2 clicks. 
The fifth step is to assemble the mouse which I would do through various steps such as installing the PCB into the bottom 3D printed plate, placing 
in the rechargeable battery, and using the screws from the G305 to attach the 3D printed mouse parts. The sixth step is to set up the mouse and 
optimize the settings, like DPI, in Logitech's mouse software(G Hub) to customize the mouse to my liking for gaming and productivity. 
The seventh and final step is to play some games with the mouse and enjoy what I have built.
