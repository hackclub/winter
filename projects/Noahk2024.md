# Automated Plant Growth System

## Summary
I am going to build an automated plant growth pod that automates plant care for indoor gardening. It has a water reservoir in the bottom of the pod with the planting soil 
container above that redistributes water to the resevoir. A probe that measures soil moisture communicates data to a raspberry pi which triggers the water pump to water 
the plant. A plant growth full spectrum LED light will be attached to an ajustable tooth support to provide light for the plant. I'm excited to build this because it'll 
be a great way to try out new components and build a system that would help me grow plants. 

## Plan

First: I'm going to connect all of my hardware on a breadboard to my raspberry pi
Second: I will source sample code online for my hardware components. I will use the uhubctl utilty to power on and off the usb ports on my pi, turning on and off 
the LEDS connected to the Raspberry Pi's USB port. https://funprojects.blog/2021/04/26/control-usb-powered-devices/ 
Third: I will modify sample code to fit my needs in an all encompassing program.
Fourth: I will CAD a case, resevoir, and tooth support beam with ONSHAPE
Fifth: I will 3D print the case, resevoir, and tooth support beam in segments, connecting them with superglue and sealing the gaps with caulking
Sixth: I will assemble the 3D printed parts 
Seventh: I will place the components in their designated places and connect them to my raspberry pi
