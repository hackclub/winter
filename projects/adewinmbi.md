# Falcon Ornithopter

## Summary

The several ornithopters (aircraft with flapping wings) I have come across online made several compromises on complexity and realism in exchange for ease-of-assembly or efficiency. But, birds still remain among most energy efficient fliers on earth. 

This project is my attempt to create the most biologically accurate ornithopter possible, for the technical challenge, possible advancements in aircraft efficiency, and fun!

## Plan

My plan involves 4 iterations, with this winter's project being the first one.

Iteration Number 

1. Ornithopter flight, membrane-based wings, folding of wings, steering with elevator and rudder on tail
2. Airfoiled wings, bird foot landing gear
3. Flight optimizations, sensors for automated flight
4. Efficiency comparison with conventional aircraft, aesthetics

I will use the tools I already own, like my Ender 3 3D printer.
