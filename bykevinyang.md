Musivue is a reactive LED music display with multi view displays: spectrum analyzer, [Spotify cover](https://github.com/phultquist/frame), or [circular graphic equalizer](https://youtu.be/cMCBEp5XiP0?t=29). The goal is to make a wall-hung portrait that portals users into the complex frequencies of your favorite songs.

## Thought Process 

I've always been obsessed with making music displayable. My first (real) PCB project was a [VU meter](https://www.instructables.com/LED-Volume-Bar/) that could go up and down with the booming sounds of your song. I then pimped a boombox with a frequency analyzer to allow for a reactive light show anywhere, anytime. I want to create a central music visualizer that taps into the Spotify API, combining various frequency display formats for one breathtaking decor piece.


## Plan

First, I am going to set up the Orange PI 0. From there, I will make it communicate with the 64x64 LED matrix and play around with drawing simple animations. Afterward, I will create various frequency display modes (spectrum analyzer, circular view, etc.) and find a way to feed them music data from the Spotify API. Afterward, I will create a sleek portrait-esque wood case to hang up on the wall.

For tools I will need:
- Soldering Iron
- Laptop
- Miter Saw
- Multi-meter
- Variable Power Supply

I fortunately already have all of these tools. I will just need to buy parts.

## Features
- [] Linear Spectrum Analyzer
- [] Circular Graphic Equalizer
- [] Spotify Album Cover
- [] Spotify Smart-Home Control Hub
    - Act as a Spotify recognized listening device able to stream music. Play that music through an onboard audio jack to a speaker.
    - Have buttons and knobs to skip songs on spotify, remotely!
- [] Music Dependent Ripple Wave
    - The LED matrix will ripple in a wave pattern that is dependent on the music playing. The wave will be more intense when the music is louder.
