Hack Clubbers love to build but are often limited only to software projects as they aren't able to access expensive electronics components 📟. So, we challenged our community to — over 10 days — build any hardware project they wanted! And we offered grants of up to $250, powered by our own [🏦fiscal sponsorship platform](https://hackclub.com/bank).

In this repository, you'll find 249 hardware projects from high schoolers, to explore and serve as inspiration at your own leisure.

## 💰 The grants

The $73k grant disbursements were powered by [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank), our fiscal sponsor and banking platform which allowed us to keep them transparent (see below) and also send money directly to high schoolers without waiting for institutional support 🏦.
