Questions asked by @bellesea:
both projects need a speaker and microphone but i believe the kit only has
one? do y'all have a plan for this?
Soham's already got a jbl speaker with built in mic, so he doesn't need the
pi speakers

do you have a screen for the holographic assistant?
yes, its included in the kit i linked (we will only be making ine of these)

do you have any plans for modifying the holographic assistant in anyway?
yeah, the housing for it is 3d printed, we plan on modifying the 3d print
files in fusion 360. We have a 3d printer available.

what are your plans for the enclosure for the holographic assistant?
written above!

when you mention already having the power supply/sd cards etc. do you mean
as part of the kit? if not, would it be better to just purchase the pi
outside of the kit?
I meant it as part of the kit, sorry for the confusion.

are you following any guides for the mirror?
what are your plans for the framing of the smart mirror?
yeah we'll be following youtube videos for making it. We have a frame which
is similarly sized to our monior. We will be using that



## Summary
Me and one of my friends will are planning to make the same projects and help each other in case either of us get stuck. We will be making a magic mirror and a holographic virtual assistant.
The mirror will recognise our faces and greet us, and will act as an alexa device. We plan on making one of us make the mirror while the other person makes the holographic assistant

thank you sm for giving us this opportunity!

## Plan Holographic Assistant
1) Gather materials:
 -Raspberry Pi
 -MicroSD card
 -Power supply for the Raspberry Pi
 -A transparent display screen (such as a transparent OLED display)
 -A holographic pyramid (a triangular prism that splits light into a holographic image)
 -A speaker and microphone for the virtual assistant
2) Set up the Raspberry Pi by inserting the microSD card and connecting the power supply. Follow the instructions for your specific version of the Raspberry Pi to complete the setup process.

3) Install the necessary software on the Raspberry Pi. You will need to install the Raspbian operating system, as well as any software or libraries needed to control the transparent display screen and communicate with the holographic pyramid.

4) Connect the transparent display screen and holographic pyramid to the Raspberry Pi. You may need to use cables or a breakout board to connect these devices to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

5) Write a Python script to control the transparent display and holographic pyramid. Use the Python libraries and software you installed to display images on the transparent screen and split the light into a holographic image using the pyramid.

6) Implement the virtual assistant functionality. You can use a pre-existing virtual assistant framework, such as Google's Dialogflow, or build your own using Python and natural language processing libraries. The virtual assistant should be able to listen for voice commands, process them, and display the results on the transparent screen as holographic images.

7) Test the holographic virtual assistant and make any necessary adjustments. Make sure the transparent display is displaying images correctly and the holographic pyramid is splitting the light into a clear holographic image.

8) Package the Raspberry Pi, transparent display, and holographic pyramid into a suitable housing. This could be a custom-made enclosure or an off-the-shelf case with modifications.

## Plan Smart mirror
1) Gather materials:
Raspberry Pi
MicroSD card
Power supply for the Raspberry Pi
A display screen (such as an LCD display)
A frame or enclosure for the display
A mirror (you can use a two-way mirror or a regular mirror with a sheet of clear acrylic in front of it)
A speaker and microphone 
A rasberry pi camera module

2) Set up the Raspberry Pi by inserting the microSD card and connecting the power supply. Follow the instructions for your specific version of the Raspberry Pi to complete the setup process.

3) Install the necessary software on the Raspberry Pi. You will need to install the Raspbian operating system, as well as any software or libraries needed to control the display screen.

4) Connect the display screen to the Raspberry Pi. You may need to use cables or a breakout board to connect the display to the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port or GPIO pins.

5) Write a Python script to control the display screen and display information on the smart mirror. You can use libraries such as Pygame or Kivy to create a graphical user interface for the smart mirror. The interface should display the time, date, and weather, as well as any other information you want to include (such as news headlines or reminders).

6) Place the display screen inside the frame or enclosure and attach the mirror to the back of the display. You can use adhesive or mounting brackets to secure the mirror in place.

7) add a speaker and microphone to the smart mirror to enable voice control. You can use a pre-existing virtual assistant framework, such as Google's Dialogflow, or build your own using Python and natural language processing libraries.

8) Test the smart mirror and make any necessary adjustments. Make sure the display is displaying the correct information and the mirror is properly secured in place.

Will also be looking through different youtube videos 

## Budget
The Products Include Delivery And Taxes!
The sensors kit contains a camera module, a speaker and a microphone. The seperate cost of all 3 of these is around 60 bucks. So its cheaper in the kit.

We will be covering the remaining cost using our own money
