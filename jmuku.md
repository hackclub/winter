## Summary
Me and one of my friends will are planning to make the same project and help each other in case either of us get stuck. We will be making a Retro PI gaming 
console. We've had this project in mind for a long time, but due to rasberry pi's being out of stock half the time+money constraints, we didn't get a chance to make this project. We are also both complete beginners to hardware and linux, and hope to learn a lot through this. The video's we will be following are:

And thank you sm for giving us this opportunity!

## Plan
1) Download the latest version of RetroPie from the official website and save it to your computer.

2) Purchase a Raspberry Pi single board computer, a microSD card, and a power supply.

3) Format the microSD card using a tool such as SD Card Formatter.

4) Extract the downloaded RetroPie image file and use a tool such as Etcher to write the image to the microSD card.

5) Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and connect the power supply.

6) Connect the Raspberry Pi to a display using an HDMI cable.

7) Follow the on-screen instructions to set up RetroPie, including configuring your controller and setting up your WiFi connection (if applicable).

8) Once the setup is complete, you can start playing games by selecting them from the main menu.

9) Use an emulator to add additional games.

I'll get my friend to add his intro as a comment on my pull request
