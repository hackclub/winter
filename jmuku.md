## Summary

I am planning on following a few tutorials online in order to build an electronic ink display for my Raspberry Pi 4. The specific project I have in mind is a weather display, and I will be using the blog post found at https://kimmo.blog/posts/7-building-eink-weather-display-for-our-home/ as a starting point. In addition to this tutorial, I will also be looking for other resources and guides on YouTube and other websites in order to gather as much information as possible. My goal is to expand on the original project and make it my own, while still keeping it relatively simple and beginner-friendly.

As a beginner, I will be looking for projects that are easy to make and have clear instructions. I will be searching on GitHub and other online repositories for projects that have been created by other users and that have been well-documented. By following these tutorials and referencing these resources, I hope to gain a better understanding of how electronic ink displays work and how to use them in my own projects. I am excited to see what I can create with the Raspberry Pi 4 and an electronic ink display, and I am looking forward to learning more about this technology.

## Plan

1) Choose an e-ink display: There are several e-ink displays available that are compatible with the Raspberry Pi 4, so you will need to choose one that meets your needs. Some things to consider when choosing an e-ink display include its size, resolution, and interface (e.g., SPI or I2C). You may also want to consider the type of e-ink technology used (e.g., monochrome or color) and the viewing angle of the display.

2) Connect the e-ink display to the Raspberry Pi: Depending on the e-ink display you choose, you may need to use a breakout board or a connector board to connect the display to the Raspberry Pi. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for connecting the display and configuring the necessary pins on the Pi.

3) Install the necessary libraries and dependencies: To control the e-ink display and retrieve data from online sources, you will need to install the necessary libraries and dependencies on your Raspberry Pi. This may involve installing Python libraries like PIL (Python Imaging Library) and e-ink specific libraries like PyEink or Waveshare E-Paper.

4) Write and test your code: Once you have your operating system and libraries installed, you can start writing and testing your code. You can use a programming language like Python to control the e-ink display and retrieve data from online sources. You can also use libraries like PIL to generate images to display on the e-ink display.

5) Assemble and set up your project: Once your code is working as expected, you can assemble your project and set it up in your desired location. Make sure to follow any additional instructions provided by the manufacturer or other tutorials you are using to ensure that your project is set up correctly.
