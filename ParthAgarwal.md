# Project Name
Nvidia Jetbot

## Summary

The plan is to create a Nvidia jetson nano powered jetbot that does basic tasks such as obstacle avoidance with the help of its onboard computer. With the help of this I
would be able to learn basic robotics concepts such as programatic motor control. Later on I can build some other useful projects out of it.

## Plan

First of all I would have to order parts from multiple stores. https://jetbot.org/master/getting_started.html have all the required steps I need to follow in order to get this project completed.
Next on I will follow the examples given on the above mentioned site to complete my project.
