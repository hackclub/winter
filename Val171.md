# Building an RC Buggy

# Summary:

Im going to build a remote controlled buggy for fun since I have never built any hardware with such complexity before. Im using a kit as it contains a lot of parts at 
a fairly reasonable rate and since it bundles up a lot of them. Looking for all of the parts separately would take a lot of time and would also go over budget. This
is also my first time doing such a project thus this would be more beneficial. Additional products like the batteries, radios, wheels, etc. I'll buy separately since
they are not included in the kit

# Plan

1. Assemble the chassis.
2. Connect the battery to the esc whcih in turn is connected to and powers the motor and receiver(connected to a bec) which powers the servo.
3. Bind the radio receiver and remote(transmitter)
4. Connecting the electronics to the mechanical components (chassis, axles, etc)
5. Powering on and driving it.
