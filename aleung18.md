# Raspberry Pi Powered Pet Feeder

Project Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx5WoefZ2h0&t=16s&ab_channel=MostElectronics

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

I am going to build a pet feeder for my dog using a Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, and driver boards. 
I am going to CAD design the feeder and print the components with my 3D printer. 
In the future, I would like to add the Raspberry Pi Camera module so that pet owners can see their dog eat when they are away. 
I am excited to build it because I will no longer have to feed my dog if successful! (Just kidding). 
Jokes aside, I am excited because it is my first “real” hardware project, and I have been trying out CAD design and playing with circuit boards 
and would like to make a project that has reflected what I have learned so far.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

1. Download and install RPImotorlib and Flask Server, libraries
2. Configure Local IP and Port
3. Start the Python Script
4. Print components and put together 3D model
5. Dispense!

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
