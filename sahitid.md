# Motion Sensor Video Recorder w/ Raspberry Pi

## Summary

I'm going to build a Motion Sensor Video Recorder that is operated using a Raspberry Pi. It will ultimately use a motion sensor to trigger video recording.

## Plan

Utilizing the Raspberry Pi, PIR sensor, and camera module, I will create a device that can detect motion (with GPIO 4) and then run a python program that records video and takes photos.
