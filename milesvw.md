# FPV Quadcopter

## Summary

I'm going to make a light and powerful drone that is fun to fly. It should be able to maintain stability in the air as well as speed through it and transmit video data back to the operator. I'm really excited to build this because I've always wanted to be able to make a drone like this, but the cost of doing so has held me back. The build will be heavily based upon [this Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfFl_-tof4Y) and some other videos and information from his channel. 

## Plan

1. Buy the parts. 
2. I am going to assemble all of the components into the frame and make sure everything fits well.
3. I am going to solder all of the electronic components to the flight and speed controller and test all of the connections.
4. I am going to load the firmware onto the drone using Betaflight. 
5. I am going to test the drone and make sure everything works. 
6. Fly it around!
