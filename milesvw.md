# FPV Quadcopter

## Summary

I'm going to make a light and powerful drone that is fun to fly, has a camera, and  What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
