# Modified Locus Keyboard

## Summary

I'm going to build a split 45% keyboard using a stack of cut acrylic parts. The goal is to build a completely different type of keyboard from the one I am using right now, and to practice improve my skills at soldering, 3D printing, silicone casting, and modification. I'm excited to work on a completely different (and far more in-depth) project than most of my other hardware work, as this will require not just computer science skills but also a knowledge of materials and manufacturing.

## Plan

1) Go to Home Depot and compare different plastics based on their flexibility and resonance (this is just to decide what material to use)
2) Submit an order for the laser-cut case
3) 3D print tracing plates for the foam inserts, as well as a mold for the silicone
4) Cut the foam using the 3d-printed plates
5) Pour the silicone into the mold, let it harden, and then remove it
6) Modify PCB to add flex cuts, using a 3d-printed map and a Dremel (this is risky, so I might not do it, depending on how flexible the PCB is in-hand)
7) Tune stabilizers, using 3d-printed inserts to reduce opening tolerances and lubricants to prevent scratching
8) Add MillMax 3305 sockets to PCB
9) 3D-print switch films
10) Install all the custom foam and silicone
11) Install stabilizers
12) Lube and film switches
13) Install switches
14) Complete assembly of the case
15) Configure Vial development environment
16) Create firmware through Vial

Total Expected Time: 15 Hours (plus cooling and printing time)
