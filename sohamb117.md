# Modified Locus Keyboard

## Summary

I'm going to build a split 45% keyboard using a stack of cut acrylic parts. The goal is to build a completely different type of keyboard from the one I am using right now, and to practice improve my skills at soldering, 3D printing, silicone casting, and modification. I'm excited to work on a completely different (and far more in-depth) project than most of my other hardware work, as this will require not just computer science skills but also a knowledge of materials and manufacturing.

## Plan

1) Go to Home Depot and compare different plastics based on their flexibility and resonance (this is just to decide what material to use)
2) Submit an order for the laser-cut case
3) 3D print tracing plates for the foam inserts, as well as a mold for the silicone
4) Cut the foam using the 3d-printed plates
5) Pour the silicone into the mold, let it harden, and then remove it
6) Modify PCB to add flex cuts, using a 3d-printed map and a Dremel (this is risky, so I might not do it, depending on how flexible the PCB is in-hand)
7) Tune stabilizers, using 3d-printed inserts to reduce opening tolerances and lubricants to prevent scratching
8) 3D-print switch films
9) Install all the custom foam and silicone
10) Install stabilizers
11) Lube and film switches
12) Solder switches
13) Complete assembly of the case

Total Expected Time: 15 Hours (plus cooling and printing time)
