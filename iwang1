# Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

My sister and I are going to build a custom mechanical keyboard. This keyboard will be able to perform macros that optimize my workflow. 
We're excited to try soldering, modding/lubing/filming switches, and programming each switch to do something unique.

## Plan

First, my sister and I researched the parts needed to complete the keyboard. 
We will need a case, switches, keycaps, a plate, and a PCB to make a keyboard. 
After we get all the parts, my sister will open all 70 switches and lube the inside to make the keyboard feel nicer. 
Afterward, I will be soldering all the switches to the PCB and then plugging everything together. 
Later, we plan to use QMK software to program the keys on the keyboard to do unique macros, like turning off the lights in my room, unlocking the front door, and turning off the computer.
