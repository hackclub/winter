# TechnoFlora

## Summary

I come from a family of gardening enthusiasts who love to spend time with their plants. However whenever we go on a vacation, most of our plants die due to lack of care. Thus, being an Arduino Enthusiast, i want to build an automatic hydroponics based plant incubator called TechnoFlora. TechnoFlora would feature technologies like hydroponics, grow lights & temperature and humidity control that would not only help the plant in growing during adverse conditions but also faster than normal during better times. I can't wait to grow and completely harvest lettuce within just a couple of weeks!

## Plan

TechnoFlora would have a lot of tricks up its sleeve that can not only help me monitor the plant growth but also help the plant grow faster tha normal.
* A Hydropnics based irrigation system to nourish the plant with appropriate nutrients while also using less water & almost no soil.
* A TDS & pH control system for the Hydroponics setup to maintain the best possible conditions.
* Industrial grade full spectrum grow lights that can artificially stimulate photosynthesis & accelerate plant growth.
* An Acryclic/ mdf cover arounnd the entire system to trap incident light & create a controlled environment.
* A temperature & humidity control system to control the temperature around the plant for best growth.
* & a Bluetooth based mobile app to display all data from the sensors on my mobile.
