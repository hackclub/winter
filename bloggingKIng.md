# Path following robots / cars

## Summary

I will be building a line following car that will follow a certain line drawn on the floor or cardboard. The car will be able to figre out its path auomatically with the help of sensors and controller. The logic behind the movement will be to use an IR sensor or something like that to detect the path and then male the bot automatically follow the path. 

## Plan

### Steps

1. Research (Yeah I am not very familiar with robotics and I will have to get help and information from google and other resources)
2. Assemble the hardware components together 
3. Coding: I will code the controller (Aurdino), using C++
4. Casing: I will add casing to the car to give it a nice look
