# Nova Synthetica

## Summary

 Over the past couple of weeks, I worked on a schematic and gathered information for a small synth that I am planning to build. It's based of a simple sawtooth VCO and a Korg MS-20 style filter. I designed it as a small synth to play around with when I'm bored.
I've always wanted to build a more 'analogue' based circuit. Normally, I build more 'digital' type of electronic circuits..
## Plan
I will write my plan from the moment I got my parts;
I will first check if I got all the parts, then I would start laying it out on a breadboard to connect them according to the [Schematic](https://imgur.com/7jxqMLZ). Then I would test it and needed to debug it.
If it all works, I Wil go and start making the layout for the prototyping board. After that, I will go and start soldering. Then I would test it again and debug if needed. Start playing with it! Maybe I am going to make a small case from some spare acrylic build, not sure tho.
