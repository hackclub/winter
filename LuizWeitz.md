# E-reader With Raspberry Pi Pico

## Summary

E-reader using Raspberry Pi Pico with E-Ink technology screen with rechargeable battery that fits in the palm of the hand, through which I intend to expand my adventures in the world of reading.

## Plan

The first step is to plan how the components will be organized. <br>
The second step is to connect all components through wire and solder.  <br>
The third step is to plan a simple case in 3d and print out. <br>
The fourth step is to create a simple software that reads the books and sends them to the screen with the possibility of changing pages.  <br>
The fifth step is to test everything.  <br>

I have follow this project https://github.com/joeycastillo/The-Open-Book to get some ideas and I also did some research on the internet regarding the components, for example the screen I will follow the manufacturer's documentation.
