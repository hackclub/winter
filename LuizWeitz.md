# Cloud Server for less than 200 dollars with self-management

## Summary

Hello, in this project I will show you how to create a high-performance cloud server in your home with self-management. 
We will have the following functions

- Heat management -> The server will control its temperature automatically, that is, if it reaches a certain temperature, it will activate 2 mini coolers until it reaches a cold temperature
- Dashboard with temperature graphics and hardware consumption
- Deploying projects via CD|CI pipeline with GitActions
- Alerts via email/consumer slack... deploy

To build we will use
- Orange Pi (8-core 64-bit processor 8GB ram)
- Golang
- Arduino language
- ESP8266
- SD card 128 gb
...
And a lot of pizza ðŸ˜‹

## Plan

First part
- Let's create a rest api using Golang and a panel using Angular

Second part
- Let's assemble our server (hardware)

Third part
- Installation and configuration of Ubuntu and our API

Fourth part
- Let's load a rest API on our server

Fifth part
- Let's connect a DNS domain to our server

OBS : I will be creating a tutorial so more members can do it at home
