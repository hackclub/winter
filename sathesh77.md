## Summary
The interface proposed uses EEG signal of brain. The signals are used for performing certain tasks based on the human thinking. The interface is predominantly designed to subordinate disabled people. The interface mainly focuses people with locomotive disability. Based on the reference points in EEG this interface imitates locomotive movements to guide disabled.
## FUTURE SCOPE
It is a miniature model for a voice controlled wheel chair( For differently abled people). They can easily controll the wheel chair though commands. In further development it can also function using neural commands(Direct impulse from the brain).

## Plan
The development has four zones. In the first zone study of biological actions of human brain, various biological markers of human EEG and its association with locomotive movements. Later blueprint workout of the model. Final stage involves in procurement and assembling the equipments. Once it's done testing involves real time testing with biological samples

## Steps
As mentioned in the development steps has different zones. Amongst studying brain through EEG has been done and study marks are marked.
With respect to wireless connectivity to work on human signals, the demonstration was done using gesture of human and connectivity was established using Bluetooth.
