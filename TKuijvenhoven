# Agriculture Drone

## Summary
I would like to make a farming drone. I am excited about this because there is a lot of horticulture in my area and this is a useful tool to help with that. 
I would like to start engineering and hope to get the chance to participate.


## Plan

First I make construction drawings then I see what I need and then I will start building the project.
