# Custom Built Keyboard

## Summary

A home made 65% keyboard for both gaming and typing

## Plan

I am going to first lubricate the switches and stabilizers. Then install the stabilizers and brass plate onto the PCB inside of the case. 
After I will install all of the switches into the board. Finally I was place the keycaps over the switches.

## Budget
