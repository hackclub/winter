# Black & White

## Summary

I am going to build a mechanical keyboard as it will serve multiple purposes, home & school. I chose to build a keyboard because this will be my very first
time building one and I am excited. 

## Plan

I kind of thought that I could just "freeball" it, I also have many friends that are into keyboard buiding so I could go to them for adivce as this is my 
first time. First, I will commence my research and then carry on from there.
