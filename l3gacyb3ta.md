# Project Name

## Summary

I want to build a super simple mesh-network, for a theoretical post-collapse world. I mean collapse as in major infrastructure failing to provide support anymore, so what most people would call off-grid (i guess i have CollapseOS brianrot :3 [^1]). Ideally this would support many forms of interaction, so it could work even if people lost acess to phones. Some previous work I am inspired by is:
- [meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)
- [disaster.radio](https://disaster.radio/)
- [LOW←TECH MAGAZINE's solar website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html)

## Plan

1. Research actual networking solutions.
2. Get a serial-based version working.
3. Build a web interface.
4. Test at a larger scale.
5. Deployment at my school!
