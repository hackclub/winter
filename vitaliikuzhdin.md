# Project Name

E-Book for Blind

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

I want to create an e-book for blind. The reason for this is because physical ones are heavy, very expensive (up to $500 per book), can only be read 3-5 times (those little "dots" get sanded away by fingers).

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

I plan on using an Arduino Uno board (as a brain), micro solenoids to show/hide tactile "dots", shift registers/expanders (to have enough pins), transistors (to open or close the segments), SD card module (to store the book itself) and a few buttons for easy navigation. 

## Budget TODO

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
