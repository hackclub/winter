# Vani

## Summary

I'd want to build my own ai assistant with raspberry pi. this is an AI home assistant like Alexa or google home. I will write this assistance from scratch with python. I will use python modules and free APIs like music, weather, calendar, Wikipedia, tweet, etc. And I will use automated room light and fan. I also try to use ChatGPT API in this project. 

## Plan

I start with raspberry setup software, then coding and assembling.
1. Setup raspberry - coding environment and necessary software and modules
2. Start coding with python - create a template using pyaudio, speech-recognition, pyttsx3, and more.
3. Add plugin and APIs like whether(geopy library for graphical data), Spotify, Automation etc
4. Make dynamic for adding more plug-ins in the future.
5. Also create a user interface for dynamic features and plugins using the flask framework.
6. connect hardware - mic, speaker, and home automation sensors with raspberry pi and two led which will indicates listening and speaking .

## Budget
These materials will i need for my project.

I didn't work on IoT before but I will really enjoy creating this project and it's helping me to improve my coding and learn AI with raspberry pi.
