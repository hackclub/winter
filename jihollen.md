# Rfid rings

## Summary

utilising the rings with RFID technology to unlock the door that is powered by ardunio. so the copier will copy the code from the add and replicate it onto the rings and then it would be able to open it with a tap, unlike conventional doorlocks which use bulky cards and stuff 

## Plan

get the rings - write it using the rfid copier and program the arduino board to be able to read it then i can unlock my doors the programming of the board will be the most taxing part, but i will try my best for this to work. i just have to program the arduino to detect the card.

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
