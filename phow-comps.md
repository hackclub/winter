# Project Name

## Summary
I want to make an fpv drone for my project.

## Plan Project 1
Gather all of the necessary materials and tools. This will likely include a drone frame, motors, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), a flight controller, a radio transmitter and receiver, a battery, and any additional accessories such as propellers, landing gear, and camera mount.

Assemble the drone according to the instructions provided with the frame and components. This may involve soldering connections and mounting the motors, ESCs, and flight controller onto the frame.

Configure the flight controller using software such as Cleanflight or Betaflight. This will involve setting up the sensors, calibrating the motors, and configuring the radio transmitter and receiver.

Install the camera and any other accessories onto the drone. This may involve mounting the camera onto the frame using a gimbal or camera mount, and attaching the landing gear or other accessories.

Test the drone to ensure it is functioning properly. This may involve performing a ground test to check the motors and flight controller, and then a flight test to verify that the drone is stable and responsive.

Fine-tune the settings and perform any necessary maintenance as needed. This may involve adjusting the PID values, replacing worn components, or updating the firmware.

## The kit im buying contains all the parts needed to make your own fpv drone. It also contains the goggles and a controller, and this is the only diy drone kit that i could find in this price range that conatined everything under 250.
