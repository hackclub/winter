# Project Name: Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

I am extremely interested in the opportunity to design and build a mechanical keyboard from the ground up. This project would not only be a new and exciting challenge for me, but it would also provide me with my first hands-on experience with hardware engineering, as I have primarily focused on software development in the past. While I am eager to tackle this project, I do not currently own a soldering iron, so I am hesitant to invest in a soldering kit that I may not be able to use effectively without the proper tools.

## Plan
I plan to spend the first few days working on the assembly of the printed circuit board (PCB), plate, and case for the mechanical keyboard. Once these components are properly assembled, I will move on to the next phase of the project, which involves lubing and assembling the switches, stabilizers, and keycaps. This process may take several additional days to complete, as I want to ensure that everything is put together correctly and functions smoothly. Overall, I am confident that with careful planning and attention to detail, I will be able to successfully build a functional and high-quality mechanical keyboard from scratch.
