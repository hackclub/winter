# Project Name

## Summary

I will be working with one of my friends on these 2 projects. I will get him to fill out the checklist below as well.

All prices are including delivers+taxes

Project1(Mechanical kb): I am extremely interested in the opportunity to design and build a mechanical keyboard from the ground up. This project would not only be a new and exciting challenge for me, but it would also provide me with my first hands-on experience with hardware engineering, as I have primarily focused on software development in the past. While I am eager to tackle this project, I do not currently own a soldering iron, so I am hesitant to invest in a soldering kit that I may not be able to use effectively without the proper tools.

Project2(Raspi e ink widget screen):
I am planning to follow a few online tutorials to build a rest API hosted on my local internet, which will allow me to change the content displayed on an e-ink dashboard using a Raspberry Pi 3. However, I think I may need to upgrade to a Raspberry Pi Pico or a Raspberry Pi 4 in order to complete this project. I have some previous experience working with Raspberry Pi hardware, so I am hopeful that this project will not be too difficult for me. I will be using the tutorial located at https://kimmo.blog/posts/7-building-eink-weather-display-for-our-home/ as a starting point, and will also reference other tutorials that are available online. Additionally, I am considering using a Kindle e-ink screen, as they are higher resolution, and can be found at https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/118380/using-a-kindle-paperwhite-screen-with-raspberry. Finally, I have an Echo Show with Alexa and a Google Nest Hub with Google Assistant, and I plan to use IFTTT to link the API to these two devices so that I can simply ask Google or Alexa to change the weather display to display a different item.

### Also, thanks to @Jaden for inspiration for the 1st project and thanks to @thinkingjet for inspiration for the 2nd project 

## Plan Project 1
I plan to spend the first few days working on the assembly of the printed circuit board (PCB), plate, and case for the mechanical keyboard. Once these components are properly assembled, I will move on to the next phase of the project, which involves lubing and assembling the switches, stabilizers, and keycaps. This process may take several additional days to complete, as I want to ensure that everything is put together correctly and functions smoothly. Overall, I am confident that with careful planning and attention to detail, I will be able to successfully build a functional and high-quality mechanical keyboard from scratch.
