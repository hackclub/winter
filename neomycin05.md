# Mech keyboard

### Summary

I am going to build a mechanical keyboard. It will be a good addition to my setup as I do not have a separate keyboard yet. I am excited to build it because I have never built a keyboard yet and I always watch keyboard build videos on YouTube all the time so I have always wanted to build one.

### Plan

Tools needed: 
- Keyboard case
- PCB compatible with that case
- Switch mounting plate
- Mechanical switches
- Stabilizers
- Keycaps
- USB cable
- Screwdriver
- Optional: Soldering tools

1. Decide What Keyboard You Want
2. Pick Out the Parts
3. Get the Equipment Required
4. Test PCB to Make Sure it Works
5. Lube Your Switches (Optional)
6. Mod Your Stabilizers (Optional)
7. Install Stabilizers Into PCB
8. Install Switches Into Plate & PCB
9. Solder Switches
10. Add Foam and Rubber Feet to The Case
11. Install Assembled PCB Into Case
12. Install the Keycaps
13. The Typing Test

### Budget
