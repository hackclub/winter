# nfc wallet

## Summary

using nfc tags to replace traditional cards in my wallet, it would be much easier to use and carry around, because of their small form factor. also to be used as rings, much easier

## Plan

getting the tags and the copier, trying to figure out how to copy and rewrite the tags, customizing them, and using it as a wallet (replacing wallet with a ring and keychain)

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
