# nfc wallet

## Summary

using nfc tags to replace traditional cards in my wallet, it would be much easier to use and carry around, because of their small form factor. also to be used as rings, much easier

## Plan

getting the tags and the copier, trying to figure out how to copy and rewrite the tags, customizing them, and using it as a wallet (replacing wallet with a ring and keychain) and the nfc reader paired the an arduino CQ robobot speaker so that it would be able to make a sound for each different card it detects

## Budget
