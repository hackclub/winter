# Project Name
AirDrop

## Summary
AirDrop is a state-of-the-art drone delivery system that brings convenience and efficiency to the forefront. Equipped with GPS navigation, this autonomous drone has the capability to carry small packages weighing up to 50 grams for distances of up to 100 meters. The AirDrop drone features advanced ultrasonic sensing technology and a miniaturized Arduino processor, all weighing less than 10 grams, to ensure precise and safe delivery. With AirDrop, receiving packages and goods has never been easier. Whether you're a busy individual, a family or a business looking for a more streamlined delivery experience, AirDrop is the solution you need.

## Plan

1. Research and purchase a high-quality, programmable drone with a stable PCB and 2.4 GHz remote control. This drone should have enough capacity to support additional components such as a GPS module.
2. Obtain a 3D-printed cube with an open top, measuring 5x5x5 cm. This cube should be made out of a durable material such as metal or plastic.
3. Modify the drone by attaching the 3D-printed cube to its top. The cube could also be hung down from the bottom of the drone, depending on the design and overall weight distribution.
4. Integrate an ultrasonic sensor and a nano Arduino (combined weight under 10 grams) into the drone. The ultrasonic sensor will be used for obstacle detection and avoidance, while the nano Arduino will serve as the controller for the sensor.
5. Overwrite the drone's original firmware with custom software that enables semi-automatic operation, such as obstacle detection and avoidance, as well as GPS navigation. Make sure to do all necessary testing to ensure the drone is able to fly safely and effectively
6. Repeat step 5 to integrate a communication system between the drone and the remote control, to allow you to monitor the delivery progress and if necessary give manual commands
