# Project Name

Split Columnar Staggered Keyboard

## Summary

I am building a mechanical keyboard split down the middle for increased ergonomics and to reduce the risk of repetitive strain injury. I plan on daily-driving this keyboard for programming, note-taking, and writing. I also plan on learning stenography using this keyboard, so the keys will be staggered vertically (aligned columns) instead of horizontally (traditional, aligned rows). I will be using Plover, an open-source stenography engine. If able, I will program per-key RGB lighting effects for added aesthetic :)  

## Plan

I will purchase the base components, including a hot-swappable PCB, plates, switches, cables, and other components to assemble manually. Fortunately, the selected PCB comes with switch sockets and a microcontroller pre-soldered. During assembly I will flash the QMK firmware onto the PCB. Once assembled, I will enable NKRO (n-key rollover), which is required for stenography. The final steps involve creating macros for everyday tasks, remapping the keys to my preference, and writing a program to handle the RGB effect.
