# Project Name
Rasberry Pi AI Assistant

## Summary

So the plan is to make a AI assitant like Google Assistent, Alexa and Siri, for home automation as well as queries answered.
It will be use for contolling the light, AC and other IOT devices in the home as well as we can get answer of queries.

## Plan

First of all I will set up the OS in the SD card of the Rasberry Pi then power it on. 
The plan is to use a Rasberry Pi as a computation device to handel the assistant SDK from Google or Amazon. 
I will require a Speaker and connect it to the Rasberry Pi and also connect a USB mic to it for taking the input.
After setting up the hardware I will connect the pi through the SSH clint and set up the SKD as test if the speaker and mic are working.
If everything is attaced and woking fine we can give a command to the Assistant and it will answer the qaueries.
