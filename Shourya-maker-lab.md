# Jungle Shoot

## Summary

We are going to build a rover that can help us get a picture of wild-life in dense woods near our place. We really like wildlife observation. We are excited about this project as we will learn new tech and real life hardware skills. This will also help us to motivate other people in our locality to see the real beauty of nature and in campaigns to protect the wildlife.



## Plan

I have quite a good experience of building robots with Raspi and electronics but want to take this as an opportunity to work with and teach my friends about hardware projects and RPIs.


1. Watch some tutorials on ppm controls from dronebot wrokshop
2. Order all the parts online 
3. Simultaneously, write the code  and make the 3d desings needed for the rover.
4. Assemble the 3D Printer and other accessories.
5. Built the rover 
6. Testing it a bit
7. Bravo it's ready!
