## Summary

I'm going to build a arduino Voice Controlled Car. This car is designed to be controlled by voice commands. This car is built using arduino uno board,Beardboard(generic), DC motor 12V, Pimoroni maker essentials, micro motors, grippy wheels, Voltage Regulator, DC/Dc gate driver, Jumper wires(Generic), HC-05 Bluetooth module, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Module (Generic),Texas Instruments Dual H-Bridge motor drivers L293D, Battery, 12 V.   

## Plan

1. Collect all the parts I need to make this project.The principle this toy concept was based on was voice recognition technology. The car operates by having a voice receiver box on it where it receives your voice commands. The car has a 50 foot radius from where it is initially place on the ground. The child interacts with the car by shouting out commands like "faster", "slower", "right", "left", and "stop". The child will be able to feel like they are in full control of the car by doing this, thus giving them the sense of being important. The child programs their own voice into the receiver so that only they can operate the car. The car has an emergency shut down when it reaches the boundary of the 50 foot radius. The child must also be within that 50 foot radius when shouting commands in order for the car to initiate the desired command
2. De-Assemble CD/DVD writers and remove unnecessary parts. (CD/DVD Scanner)
3. Make a Pen Holder with the servo motor.
4. Connect wires to the CD/DVD writers and also to the servo motor.
5. Connect Arduino with the Motor Shield and then connect all the wires coming from motors and servo.
6. Assemble all items (CD/DVD Driver, Pen Holder and Arduino Board). After that connect the LCD Display to the machine which can be used to show the item currently drawing and show the stats of the drawing. (Ex:- How many percentages of the drawing has completed.)
7. Program the machine with arduino IDE to verify if everything is working as expected.
8. Program the web dashboard which can be used to convert normal images to machine understandable code. (This is a 2 software process made into 1)
9. Prepare the machine for the first testrun by using inkspace software and makerboard G-code to generate a g-code for the image and then run the machine. (First I'm    going to use the software and then test the dashboard)
10. Test the custom made dashboard by running the machine again using the dashboard generated g-code.
11. Complete the project if everything work as expected.

No shipping costs are included because the prices included in the table is very similar to the prices in my local electronic store. I can confirm every item listed here is available in the store and don't need to ship them from overseas.
