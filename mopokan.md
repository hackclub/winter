# OpenKlino

## Summary
  OpenKlino is a project about 3D Clinostat or another name Random Position Machine(RPM). This apparatus has been used in space science research to simulate long-term 
  microgravity for Biology experiments ex. Changes in Plant Growth Processes under Microgravity Conditions Simulated by a Three-Dimensional Clinostat [Hoson et al.1992)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02489403)
  The most interesting of this project is there is no Youtube or website tutorial that mentions how to build it in a frank way. The thing that I can rely on is 
  research papers from the past. So this project is like challenging my potential and If this project is successful, I can use my own Random Position Machine(RPM) 
  to conduct the future experiment without renting the expensive Random Position Machine(RPM) from the vendor website!


## Plan

On the first day, I will design the whole RPM structure and test my design in the CAD program. on day 2 If everything is the right way, I will start to assemble 
all parts and Test the machine in the real world.on days 3-10, I will Tune my machine so it can work with accuracy.
