# Project Name
Sound-Reactive Light Show

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

We are going to build a sound-reactive light show where the LED lights move based on speaker audio. This light show will be controlled by a microcontroller and a software program. We are extremely excited for this project because we currently do not have any audio system in our room and this would be such a cool feature in our room. We also mostly work with software, so this will be a great way to flex our muscles with some hardware. 

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
1. Gather materials: We will need speakers, a microcontroller (Arduino), LED lights, and a program to do the magic.

2. We will set up the microcontroller and LED lights

3. Create a short program to code the lights based on audio input

4. Test and enjoy the creation!

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
