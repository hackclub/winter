# Gesture Control Robot


## Summary

Gesture Robot is an electronic car controlled by the movement of circuit. It can be mostly used in real 
life robot fights and car fights. It is a car that can be controlled according to the userâ€™s movement of the 
hands. The transmitter part will be attached to the hand of the user and its receiver will act as the 
motherboard of the car. As the transmitter moves, it will send the signals to the receiver in the car and it 
will turn and run the car according to the instructions.

## Plan

First of all, the chassis of car is going to be made. It will contain four motors and rubber wheels attached 
to the frame of the robot made out of PlyWood. To make the frame a drill hammer set will be requied 
and a scredriver kit to screw everything in place. After that, the motors will be connected with motor shield driver. 
After that, the Arduino Nano will be attaced to Male female Pin Strip and then it
is connected to the RF module using Male to female connectors and it acts as a transmitter with the power supply 
of li-ion battery which will be attaced in the battery holder. A mini Switch will be used to turn it on and off.
Theother Arduino Nano is connected with RF Module and ADLX335 Module and it acts as a receiver with 
power supply from 9V Battery. I am using a breadborad to house all the components of the controll in it.
The code would be uploaded to both the Arduinos to make them transmit and receive signals and then the circuit works.
After doing all the tesing and finilizing the project I will make a cover out of Acrylic sheet to cover the Circuit.
