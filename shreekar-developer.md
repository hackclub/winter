# Custom NAS

## Summary

My brother, my friend and I want to combine our interets in PC building and 3D printing and create a custom PC network attached storage.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
We will cut the wood to size using the saw and create the sides of the case. We will use dowels to support the internal structure. We will then put mesh on it for dust filtration. We will use the 3D printer to create fan frames, motherboard mounts and storage mounts. We will use the 3D printer to come up with multiple versions to find the best solution. We will then put together the PC with all the components in the case and install a NAS operating system.

If we have more time, we will work on these potential ideas:
PiHole
Octoprint Monitoring Software
Docker Containers with other tools
Home IoT
Homeassistant software

For the smart mirror project, Aditya will use his RPI with these cameras and sensors and put it together in a wooden frame. He will then work through the software to configure it to his needs. He will also 3d print any brackets or attachments/holders he needs making revisions for these parts as needed.

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
