# 3-d printed claw

## Summary

Using tinkerCAD and Autodesk's Fusion360, I hope to play around with some 3-d printing software and build a claw for my robot. I'm really excited to try out 3-d printing for the first time.
I've been wanting to 3-d print a claw (for a few years actually), but I have not been able to purchase one yet. I think that a 3-d printed claw will really take my robot to the next level and I can even 3-d print other parts. We also need a new pulley system, and rather than purchasing it, we can 3-d print it! We want to also design and print a custom storage for our game consoles (used in junction with our robot). If the 3-d printer claw works out, we can add in a touch sensor and code the servos so that the claw opens if it touches something.

## Plan

1. Set up the 3-d printer, get familiar with how it works
2. Do some test runs, maybe a few cute rings and other small things (maybe rings and earrings with our team logo)
3. Create the design I want (I have some references for different claw shapes)
4. designs: [claw 1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsolidedge.siemens.com%2Fen%2Fresource%2Ftutorial%2F3d-cad-tutorial-robot-claw%2F&psig=AOvVaw1P7ZFkZIH9cBErjBeixrr_&ust=1673034323105000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCJDq5d2YsfwCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD), [pulley design](https://www.gobilda.com/3407-series-hub-mount-winch-pulley-dual-spool-112mm-circumference/)
5. 3-d print the design
6. Make changes and try out other designs if not satisfied
7. Assemble claw using servo and screws

## Budget

We're a team of 10 people.
