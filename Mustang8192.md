# Ultimate PC Mic Setup

## Summary
Communication in this world is extremely important and humanity found alternate ways to communicate with each other at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
As a dedicated robotics student I can relate to that; I remeber vividly that I used to stay up for days just thinking in my bed until an idea clicks. Then
I immediately go and CAD the design to show my teamates. When the design's rough draft is done, I call them, mainly over Discord, to screen share with them
the design. Then comes the collaboration on minimizing all inefficiencies as possible. But then I remeber that I don't have a microphone or camera connected to my
computer. Right now I use my phone and point the camera at the cad design and use the inbuilt mic to talk. This is not the most efficient way to do this; the most efficient way is to have a
microphone and camera connected to my computer and then screen share and talk. This brings me to my project. I want to spec and build a micophone setup that can help 
me collaborate with my team mates better. I am excited for this because it would be my first project outside of robotics and it will allow me to do my job
in robotics better.

## Plan
1. Order all necessary materials
2. When all materials arrive, mainly the mic arm, it needs to be assembled.
3. Attach the Mic arm to the controller. This is done by 3d printing the mic cartridge. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3350838 This is one for a Shure
SM58. I plan on using a Shure sm48, and the specs are not that much different. I plan on modifying this file and 3d printing it out on my school's 3d 
printer.
4. I will run the XLR cable from the Mic to the Elgatio XLR Wave.
5. I will then connect the Elgato XLR Wave to my computer via a USB-C cable
6. Then I will install Elgato's Wave Link software to configure the XLR Wave
7. Put webcam on top of the monitor
8. Plug in the webcam
9. Collaborate with my teamates
