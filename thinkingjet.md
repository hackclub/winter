# All the stuff given above

## Summary

So, all the things that im building(excluding the drone) are reusing the materials. However, the price will be greater than 250 usd, which im willing to
chip in myself. 
### Project 1 details
 -  Gonna try following a few tutorials online. I have a rasberry pi 3 already, but I think a pico/rpi4 will be needed. 
 -  Ill make a rest api, hosted on my local interent. Through which ill be able to change the things being displayed on the e-ink dashbaord
 -  Its not too hard or too easy, ive worked with rasberry pi related hardware before, so hopefully its alright.
 -  https://kimmo.blog/posts/7-building-eink-weather-display-for-our-home/ gonna expand on this + a few more tutorials available online
 -  also this: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/118380/using-a-kindle-paperwhite-screen-with-raspberry (Kindle e-ink screens are higher res)
 -  finally, i have an echo show(alexa) and a google nest hub(google assistant) already available. Im gonna try using IFTTT to link the api to these two so i can simply ask google/alexa to change the weather display to something

### Project 2 details
 - Its gonna be very similar to the project above, except there will be a mirror and monitor instead of an e-ink screen. 
 - Theres existing software available for the smart mirror, so hopefully i won't have to do much on the software side of things.
 - https://learn.adafruit.com/android-smart-home-mirror gonna try following this tutorial

### Project 3 details
 - Ive made this before using a digispark attiny 85 board. It was a bit slow but it worked. Gonna try replicating what I did with a rasperry pi zero W/Rasberry pi pico. 
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_f9p-_JWZw gonna try following this tutorial

### Project 4 details
 - Not making the project, as i have no previous experience with this, and don't have enough money either
## Plan

 - While wating for the hardware to arrive, ill be working on the rest api for the first/2nd project. 
 - Once the hardware arrives, it'll be pretty straightforward to set things up and connect the software and hardware. 
 - Ill try project 3 with the rasberry pi 3 that i already have available while waiting for the pico/rpi4 to arrive.
 - Rest of the plan is listed in the project details section
