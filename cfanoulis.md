# Veeby Deeby

##  Summary
I'm planning to create a smart vote colection system for hackathons, student science fairs & relevant events. Users will submit their details via an app running on the Raspberry Pi server, which will then print a submission receipt, like [this](https://hey-google.wheres-my-ta.co/5QFLM3iyo.png). After that, the voters may either scan the QR code on the receipt or enter the project ID on a web app hosted on the rPi to cast their vote (or votes). Operators may declare the vote finished, and have a tally of votes printed by the rPi, to allow them to declare their winners!

##  Plan
I expect the first 5 days to be spent on creating the web-app using RedwoodJS & Tailwind, as well as the low-level print daemon using Rust, allowing another 2 to be spent for troubleshooting them.  I expect to spend at least one day setting up the thermal printer & the rPi. The final day will be spent on troubleshooting the system as one, intergrated whole & recording a promo video, maybe :>
