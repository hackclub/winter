project: "Artificial Rescuer"

## Summary

With the increasing threat of climate change, greater populations and consequently, more extreme environmental events
the need for better emergency rescue services is paramount
As time moves forward, natural disasters will continue to wreak havoc on cities and counties around the world, 
causing many people to die. Bolstering the power of search and rescue teams with autonomous UAVs that can identify people
in disaster relief zones could significantly reduce the impact tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, etc...
My solution to strengthening search and rescue operations is to outfit an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 
with a computer vision system that detects the location of people as the vehicle flies over ground. The powerful neural-network capabilities
of the Jetson Nano Dev Kit will enable fast computer vision algorithms to achieve this task. Joseph Redmon's YOLOv3 algorithm will be used 
to do the actual object-detection (people) in the camera's view
