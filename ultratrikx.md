# 5" FPV Drone

## Summary

I am going to be building a weather/flight station to collect data about my environment and neighbourhood. It will collect information such as the speed, altitude and heading of planes in the vicinity. It will also collect information about the weather such as tempereture, percipitation, humidity and air pressure. Using this abundance of data I can then analyze trends in the environment and see how they correlate with flight patterns in my area. Other functionalities include notifications to my phone detailing weather conditions and IOT intergration with google home to find out what flight is flying above my home at a given time. I am excited to work on this project because I will be exploring meteorology, aviation, IOT and radio-frequency engineering which will further advance my skillset as an aspiring engineer and give me valuable hands on experience.
