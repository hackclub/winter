# New Mechanical Keyboard 

## Summary

I'm going to build a new mechanical keyboard. I will use it to type and navigate through my computer. I'm excited to build it because I've always been a fan of mechanical keyboards and I've been wanting to build a better one.

## Plan

The first step will be taking apart the Keychron Q1. I will be taking off the keycaps and switches, and removing the steel plate inside of it. Next, I will install the brass plate, because I prefer the sound that a brass plate produces over the sound that a steel plate produces. I will then be taking apart and lubing the alpaca linear switches, to create a smoother feel and sound. Next, I will put the switches on the plate. Finally, I will put on all of the keycaps, and the keyboard will be ready to use!
