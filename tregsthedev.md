# The Anti-Lazy Study Helper

## Summary
I'm going to be making something that helps me study. I've found that listening to music, mostly lofi and sometimes songs that have lyrics or what you hea r on the radio, help me study a lot. I can use my laptop to set a timer, and play audio though I end up getting distracted, and wasting time sometimes.
I want to make this to make it simpler for myself to get started, and help myself get more work done. 

## Plan
I plan on going over how every compoent works, and how I can connect it to the feather. I also plan on learning how to 3d model and print a case. before the 10 days, I plan on pratcing how to solder wires on the extra breadboard that I'm getting. I'll be trying to do all of this before the 10 days
During the 10 days, I'll be assembling all of the compoents together, and after that's done, I'll be using circutpython to program everything together
