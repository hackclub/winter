# Project Name
Mechatronic Hand
 
## Summary
 
I recently learnt of the existence of smart materials such as nitinol, and when I did a quick search, was shocked to find that it was accessible to me. This made me wonder why I haven’t seen it in use more. Many people have attempted making moveable electronic hands, however, I wanted to try something new in this field by using nitinol to electronically control the movement.  I want to experiment to see if this could be the future of bionics. 

## Plan
Firstly, I can use a simple string-based hand that can be 3D printed. My brother bought a 3d printer for the house, so I can use an existing file to do this. However, since this requires very precise 3D printing, I would like to first upgrade the 3D printer to have automatic bed levelling to make this possible. I have already bought some cheap nitinol wire and made a quick model using simply a switch and a battery. It showed potential, but the contraction was not enough for the full range of motion. So, I instead plan to use nitinol springs to act as the muscles of the hand and an Arduino microcontroller to make it fully automatic.  I can also add things like a controller to control it, or a camera with a program that allows it to mirror my hand. Some extra functions for the hand I plan are to make it solar powered if possible, to promote sustainable energy usage. And I want it to have a child friendly aesthetic by using rainbow colours.
