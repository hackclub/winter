# Autonomous Self Driving Tesla CyberTruck 

## Summary

Building a self-driving car using a Raspberry Pi in the shape of a Tesla Cybertruck is an exciting project that showcases the potential of combining cutting-edge technology with innovative design. As a maker and a car enthusiast, I am deeply passionate about this project and am excited to take on the challenge of creating a fully autonomous vehicle using a Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi, with its powerful processing capabilities and wide range of connectivity options, would serve as the brain of the car, controlling all the functions of the vehicle such as navigation, obstacle detection, and control of the motors and wheels. The GPS and Compass modules would be used for navigation, while additional sensors such as cameras and lidar would be used for obstacle detection.

To bring the Tesla Cybertruck design to life, I would use a miniature replica of the vehicle as the base and use 3D printing to create the body of the car. The motors, wheels, and battery would be used to control the movement of the robot. I will 3d print the shell of the car with the ender3 v2. link to the 3d model [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cybertruck-558ea6c828e64a87ae25ade1531c4180]

I am confident that this project would be a rewarding and challenging experience that would allow me to learn and grow as a maker. I am excited to dive into the details of the project and to bring my passion for cars and technology to life in the form of a self-driving Raspberry Pi-powered Tesla Cybertruck.





## Plan

A self-driving robot using a Raspberry Pi, GPS module, and Compass module in a miniature Tesla Cybertruck-like car would require the following materials:

Raspberry Pi single-board computer
GPS module
Compass module
Miniature Tesla Cybertruck-like car
Motors, wheels and battery for car
Motor controller board
Wifi dongle
Camera module
Power supply
Cables and wires for connecting the components
Programming languages such as Python
Additional hardware for robot's body and other sensors.

The Raspberry Pi would be used as the main controller for the robot, and the GPS and Compass modules would be used for navigation. The miniature Tesla Cybertruck-like car would be used as the base vehicle, and the motors, wheels, and battery would be used to control the movement of the robot. The motor controller board would be used to control the motors and wheels, and the Wifi dongle would be used to connect the Raspberry Pi to a wireless network. The camera module could be used for vision and additional sensors could be used for obstacle detection. The robot would need to be programmed using Python or any other suitable programming language.
