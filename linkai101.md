# Split-flap display

## Summary
I'm building a split-flap display inspired from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WQftf1Qio) project. This display will contain a row of 4-10 flippable characters and can be used to display time or other strings of text. The split-flap display works with sets of half-panels spinned in a rotary to display characters.

## Plan
I will use a 3D printer to print out the flaps that make up the characters on the display as well as the structure of the display. Stepper motors will turn the mechanism that rotates through the characters, and hall effect sensors will be used to keep track of rotation positions of each character.

## Budget
I'm relatively new to hardware, so I'll be learning as I go. I've included `Misc. materials` in case I need any small components that I hadn't thought of before, but I've included all significant materials needed.
