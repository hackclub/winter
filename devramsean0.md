# Pico-temp

## Summary
This is a temperature monitor for water filled environments,
the waterproof sensor is the only thing that will go into the water, and all the control equipment sits next to it, on dry land
has relay support (and associated safety stuff, like making sure 240v can't get water on) in order to provide a on / off function. and a new heater because i can't turn off the old one or it will kill my fish as this project is going to manage the heating of my tank aswell as measuring temperature. I need the usb cable sto power the three Pico's that power it. (2 to measure temperature, and one to manage the screen / relay)

## Plan

I am going to assemble this onto a breadboard first to check my logic works. and then i will order a custom PCB from JLCPCB to assemble it more pernamently
my steps will be approximatly:
1. assemble the 240v power switching relay (day --smth-- (depends on when the guy who agreed to help me is around))
1. place pico and display onto breadboard and wire it up (day 1)
2. get the pico outputting "hello world" to the display (day 1)
3. attach the temperature sensor (day 1)
4. build the software to measure from the sensor and output to the display (day 2 - 4)
5. test deploy (day 4)
6. get pico sending data to adafruit IO (day 5)
7. buy and design PCB (day 6)
8. build PCB (day 8)
9. deploy (day 8)
