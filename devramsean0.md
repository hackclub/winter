# Project Name
Pico-temp
## Summary
This is a temperature monitor for water filled environments,
the waterproof sensor is the only thing that will go into the water, and all the control equipment sits next to it, on dry land

## Plan

I am going to assemble this onto a breadboard first to check my logic works. and then i will order a custom PCB from JLCPCB to assemble it more pernamently
my steps will be approximatly:

1. place pico and display onto breadboard and wire it up
2. get the pico outputting "hello world" to the display
3. attach the temperature sensor
4. build the software to measure from the sensor and output to the display
5. test deploy
6. get pico sending data to adafruit IO
7. buy and design PCB
8. build PCB
9. deploy
