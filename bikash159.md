# Project Name
Human Following Robot

## Summary

A human following robot is a type of robot that is designed to follow a human as they move around. 
These robots are typically equipped with sensors that allow them to detect the presence of a human 
and adjust their movement accordingly. They may be used in a variety of settings, including hospitals, 
airports, and other public spaces, where they can assist with tasks such as carrying items or providing 
directions. Overall, the primary function of a human following robot is to provide assistance 
amand support to humans by following them and performing tasks as needed.

## Plan

To create a human following car using the specified components, I will follow these steps:

First I will make the car chassis out of Acrylic Sheet by attaching the Mecanum wheels to the TT Gear Motor and then to the Chassis.
To make the chassis I will first cut Acrylic sheet in a rectangular shape using appropriate tools which I already own.
Then I will attach the L293D Motor Driver Shield to the car chassis.Then I will connect the Mu vision sensor to the Arduino Uno using a 
suitable male to female connectors. To power the car I am going to use 18650 Li-ion battery. I will also use a switch to control the power.
Then I will connect the TT Gear Motor to the L293D Motor Driver Shield using suitable wires or cables.
After I will upload the necessary code to the Arduino Uno to control the car's movement and the Mu vision sensor, that I am currently working on.
This code will include instructions for detecting the presence of a human in the vicinity of the car and adjusting the car's movement accordingly.
Then comes the testing part the car's human following functionality by placing a human within the range of the Mu vision sensor and observing 
how the car responds. I may need to make adjustments to the code or the car's hardware as needed to ensure proper operation. After that I will
code the robot to follow  Traffic Sign and take decisions accordingly. This robot will have to mode one Human Following Robot and the second 
 Traffic Sign Recognition Robot.
