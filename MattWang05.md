# PunchMe, Moder Spotify Music Player

## Summary

Project 1- PunchMe:
This device will check how hard a punching bag was hit like one of those arcade punching bags. I want to practice boxing and this will let me determine how hard I am able to hit the bag. I am excited to build this because it will allow me to get into a new sport while seeing my progress over time. 

Project 2- Modern Spotify Music Player:
We are building a modern day spotify music player. There will be many rfid cards that you can tap onto a section of the music player. When it is tapped, the song, playlist, or album that is linked onto the rfid card will play from speakers. I am excited to build this project because it’s fun to make this music player interactive.


## Plan

PunchMe:
We are going to attach an accelerometer to the top of a punching bag. This accelerometer will be attached to an arduino uno r3 which will calculate the “power” based on the reading from the accelerometer. The arduino will be powered by battery so there will be no wires in the way.

Modern Spotify Music Player:
We are connecting an rfid scanner to a raspberry pi 4 and place it in a box. We will encode multiple rfid cards with links to songs, albums, and playlists. So when an rfid card is tapped to the section of the box with the rfid scanner, a speaker will play the song, album, or playlist that is connected to the card. This will use the spotify api to connect to my profile and play the songs.
