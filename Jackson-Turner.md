# Toys come to life

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

I am going to build a camera to track what your toys do when you are not in the room. Using OpenCV I will be able to track the movement of anything within a 
frame of video. I am excited to continue working on furthuring my OpenCV knowledge and getting to track toys.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

First I will set the camer up in a location where it will expirience relative little shaking. After that I will via the raspberry 
pi start processing the data specifically looking at the movement of the recognized toys in the frame. I will them output a picture where the path of the toy 
is drawn. TO go more minute I will utilize a nural network to recognize toys first. Then ultilizing open CV through a set period of time that could be idefinitely
extended i will track the movement of the toys. At first the program will probabaly be limited to one or two toys but throughout development I hope to get that up.
