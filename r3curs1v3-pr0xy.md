# Project Name

## Raspberry Pi as a Cloud Server

## Summary

I'm going to build a personal cloud server for my home network using Raspberry  Pi and NextCloud software. The Raspberry Pi series of barebone computers are almost perfect for I want to create our own server at home to serve web pages to the internet or host our own sets of sites and services for your own use. This can be also used as self hosted personal cloud code editor to intereact with other developers from my class.

## Plan

1. Get all the material for the build, wait for it to arrive.
2. Install Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi using  Raspberry Pi Imager tool.
3. Connect the device to my local network and enable port forwarding in router to expose Raspberry Pi and can be accessed from Internet.
4. Install the server softwares such as Apache, mysql, nginx, etc

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
