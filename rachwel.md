## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

I plan on building a [SnowCat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdL4M4JpdsU) like rc vehicle. It will be controlable with a 2.4gh rc controller and be powered by 2 moters. Im exited to build it as I have never build something like this before and want to learn the experience. 
## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

1. Design the tracks and the main gears in solidworks
2. Design the gearbox in solidworks and test to see what reduction I need
3. Design the body in solidworks and print everthing out on a 3d printer
4. Put together the moter and gearbox and test to make sure its working properly 
5. Build all the track pieces and hope I have enough
6. Assembly the body with the motors, tracks, and shell
