# 3D printed Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

My sister and I are going to build a custom mechanical keyboard. We will use a 3D printer to print out the case, keycaps, and plate to construct the keyboard's base. We will then solder all the switches to the keyboard. This keyboard will be able to perform macros that optimize my workflow. 
We're excited to try soldering, modding/lubing/filming switches, and 3D modeling and printing. 

## Plan

First, my sister and I researched the parts needed to complete the keyboard. 
We will take a scan of a keycap we already have. We will then 3D model that keycap and print it out until its the correct print. Then we'll 3D model a case and plate.
After my sister will open all 70 switches and lube the inside to make the keyboard feel nicer. 
Afterward, I will be soldering all the switches to the PCB and then plugging everything together. 
After everything is done printing, we will assemble the entire keyboard together.
Later, we plan to use QMK software to program the keys on the keyboard to do unique macros, like turning off the lights in my room, unlocking the front door, and turning off the computer.
