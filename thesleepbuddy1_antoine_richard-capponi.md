# TheSleepBuddy (cross project with my friend @LiricTech)
## Summary

I’m going to build a smart litle box with many functionalities like an alarm clock, a temperature sensor, leds that wakes you up or speakers to play calm music to sleep. The idea behind this project is that my friend will make a replica with different functionalities/sensors and the two boxes will connect together to send informations like kind messages (idk). My friend will also make his own pull request when he'll be ready.

## Checklist before submitting proposal:

- [x] I am a current high school student (or younger).
- [x] I have submitted an RSVP at <https://hackclub.com/winter>
- [x] I am a member of the Hack Club Slack (Join at <https://hackclub.com/slack>)
- [x] I have self-reviewed my project proposal.

## Plan

1) Order everything

2) Prototype printing the case in my local FabLab

3) making the final case with polypropylene and wood

4) Program the arduino to do everything I want
 
	4.1) Program the Adafruit LEDS 
	[4.2) Program and connect the temperature sensor to the arduino and to the LEDS.][only if I have the budget after CNC machining and buying the polypropylene parts ]
	4.2) Program the speakers to connect to them in bluetooth with your phone 
	4.3) Program the Segemented display to make a timer before sleep
	4.4) program the LCD display to show the current weather and room temperature with the temperature sensor
5) Assemble everything !
