# Project Name
LED Network Speakers
## Summary
Basically a ton of microcontrollers and speakers in a small lamp that can send data to each other through a phone. Useful as a gift to a friend so you can scream
in their room while they're sleeping.

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?
I am building it because I want to stay connected with my friends and it seems fun to annoy them. I will first build the lamp; the lamp has a speaker and a microcontroller
inside of it. The microcontroller can control what the speaker says and it can control the LED lights. Next, I will build a website that can control all the other speakers
given permissions and security. I will make sure that it won't be too annoying though.
## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
I have no experience whatsoever with arduino/microcontrollers, so forgive me if the plan sounds a bit elementary. 

1.) Set up working wireless lamp.
2.) Set up the rest of them.
3.) Connect them through API
4.) Code website to easily change lights
5.) Test Test Test!
6.) repeat
