## Summary

Robot arms are so facinating and versitale. I already have a 3D printer so it makes it so much more possible! I plan to try to implement computer vision later on, it'll be a fun challenge for me in terms of software as well. There are so many possibilities with what I can do.
I've had some experience working with hardware but not much, this will be a great opportunity for me to learn!

## Plan

I'll mainly be following [this guide](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/scara-robot-how-to-build-your-own-arduino-based-robot/) by How to Mechatronics, it's very detailed and also provides room for me to adapt the project.
1. Print everything, this will take over a week so I probably should complete that before the 10 days starts.
2. Assembly! This should be quite straight foward if nothing goes wrong. 
3. Code it. I want to attempt to code it from scratch instead of using code the guide provided as a challenge, it'll be fun tinkering! 
4. If I still have time, I want to attempt making it sort LEGOs.
