# Quadcopter Drone

## Summary
Built with @omtripathi12 @@Krishna77vids 
A drone is a small, unmanned aircraft that is typically controlled remotely by a pilot or through a pre-programmed flight path. 
Drones are used for a wide range of purposes, including surveillance, photography, mapping, delivery, and scientific research.
Building a drone can be an exciting and challenging project, as it involves a combination of engineering, design, and programming skills. 
The goal is to create a device that is capable of stable, controlled flight, and that can perform a variety of tasks depending on its design and purpose.
will be making this project with my friend Om tripathi .
Not following a guide but with extensive research learning about how drones work (such as through watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_XneaFmOmU)
## Plan

Step 1 We begin by gathering all the necessary parts and tools for assembling the drone. This includes the main body of the drone, the propellers, motors, battery, and any additional components that are specific to our particular drone model. We also gather a few tools, such as a screwdriver and a pair of pliers.

Step 2 Printing out the 3d parts (I created the necessary STL files in Fusion 360) 

Step 3 With all the necessary parts and tools on hand, we start the assembly process. First, we attach the motors to the body of the drone. Each motor is connected to a specific arm of the drone, and we use screws or bolts to secure them in place. We make sure that the motors are securely fastened, as they will be responsible for lifting the drone off the ground.

Step 4 Next, we attach the propellers to the motors. The propellers have a specific orientation, and we make sure that they are facing the correct direction. We can usually tell which way the propellers should face by looking for a small arrow or line on the base of the propeller.

Step 5 With the propellers in place, we install the battery and any additional electronics, such as a flight controller or GPS module. We make sure that all of these components are securely fastened and properly connected to the main body of the drone.

Step 6 Finally, we test the drone to make sure that everything is working properly. This involves turning on the drone and using a remote control to move it through the air. If everything seems to be working correctly, we can start using our drone for flights.
 
Step 7 3d printing the stand we will control the servos directly through Apm 2.8 as there are extra channels for servo or we can also use the the receiver in drone as it also has channel outputs but we are thinking to use apm instead



Overall, I am excited to build a drone because it presents a unique opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to create a device that can perform
a wide range of tasks and functions. The prospect of being able to design and build a machine that can fly and perform various tasks is incredibly rewarding, 
and I am eager to be a part of this process.
