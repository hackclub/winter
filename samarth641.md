# Quadcopter Drone

## Summary

A drone is a small, unmanned aircraft that is typically controlled remotely by a pilot or through a pre-programmed flight path. 
Drones are used for a wide range of purposes, including surveillance, photography, mapping, delivery, and scientific research.
Building a drone can be an exciting and challenging project, as it involves a combination of engineering, design, and programming skills. 
The goal is to create a device that is capable of stable, controlled flight, and that can perform a variety of tasks depending on its design and purpose.
will be making this project with my friend Om tripathi .

## Plan

There are many different approaches to building a drone, and the specific steps will depend on the specific design and goals of the project. Some common steps that may be involved in the process might include:

step 1.Research and planning: This may involve gathering information about the desired capabilities and features of the drone, 
as well as researching different designs and technologies that may be suitable for the project.

step 2.Design:  I'm looking for a 3D printer to help me print the frame for my drone project. On Amazon, I discovered a suitable model https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07DGV2L8Z/ref=oxscactimage2?smid=A265UAHVFOFJA3&psc=1.  and I also needed the necessary filament, but I couldn't include the printer because it exceeded the price limit. The listed prices include 18% taxes. I created the necessary STL files in Fusion 360 and did extensive research on the subject, including watching a Lesics video on drone functionality and how drone works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_XneaFmOmU . I'm excited to finally be able to work on this project, which I've been thinking about for a long time.

step 3.Fabrication: This may involve using a variety of tools and equipment to fabricate the different parts and components of the drone. This might include tools such as 3D printers, lathes, and milling machines, as well as manual fabrication techniques such as welding and soldering.

step 4 .Assembly: This may involve putting all of the different parts and components of the drone together, 
following the plans and drawings developed in the design phase. This might involve using tools such as screwdrivers,
wrenches, and pliers to fasten the various components together.

step 5.Testing and debugging: This may involve using various tools and techniques to test the functionality and performance of the drone, 
and making any necessary adjustments or repairs. This might involve using sensors and other diagnostic equipment to identify any problems or 
issues with the device, and working to resolve them.

step6 6.Final fitting and adjustments: This may involve making any necessary final adjustments to the drone to ensure that it is ready for flight. 
This might involve adjusting the mechanical structure or control system, or installing any additional components or payloads.

Overall, I am excited to build a drone because it presents a unique opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to create a device that can perform
a wide range of tasks and functions. The prospect of being able to design and build a machine that can fly and perform various tasks is incredibly rewarding, 
and I am eager to be a part of this process.
