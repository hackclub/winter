# Resin Printed Custom Keycap

## Summary

We're going to print custom keycaps using a resin printer. We will design the keycaps ourselves and we're excited to customize them! We will like to try many ideas on keycaps such as a geology theme (!!!) or function keys that depict what they actually do. This opportunity to make these keys our own and create keycaps we can't find on the market is what we love about this project.

## Plan

We will first need to design the keycaps we want to print. Neither of us have experience with 3d printing but we have researched a lot to ensure we will complete our project successfully. We plan on using [these keycap models](https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/cherry-mx-keycaps) as a template for our custom keycaps. We will edit the design using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) as it is free and has a user interface that is good for beginners. Once our files are complete, we will use [Lychee Slicer](https://mango3d.io/downloads/) to convert them to a file that our printer will understand. After printing our keycaps, we will put them into our respective barebones kit and test them out. 

We are close friends and go to the same school so sharing the products with one another will be no issue. We will be easily able to handoff the shared products like the printer and switch lube to one another.
