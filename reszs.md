# Project Name

Build a silent mechanical keyboard

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

I will be building a modified keyboard that is silent, this keyboard is able to put in information with letters into a source, this keyboard has modifications such as
very silent switches, additionally adding lubing to these switches and a foam under the PCB will make this keyboard more silent than it already is. This prevents
anyone who's near me to be annoyed by the sounds of loud clicking, this keyboard will also have bluetooth capabilities. I am very excited to build this keyboard 
because it's going to be a new experience for me and I hope to learn more about this specific hardware. 

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

I will be building a modified mechanical keyboard by hand, I first need the parts of a keyboard, these are the case/frame, plates, keyboard stabilizers, PCB, Switches,
lube, foam, and keycaps.

First, I need to identify what my desired specs should be for the keyboard, this is already decided. The keyboard will be a 65% layout, with GAMAKAY Pheonix Switches 
(these switches are very silent which is convenient for me). 

Second, I will be getting a keyboard kit from GAMAKAY, this kit contains the case, plates, stabilizers, and PCB.

Third, I will attatch the foam to the keyboard by first measuring the foam to fit inside the keyboard, then I will take out the PCB from the keyboard and place down 
the foam under the PCB. After attatching the foam, I will put the PCB back on top.

Fourth, I will be lubing my switches, this is done by disassembling each individual switch piece using a switch opener, seperating those switch parts, then applying
lube to the half of the gold switch pins, half of the lube to both the slider rails, then I will be adding lube to the ends of the springs, after lubing the spring
I will be attatching it back to the bottom switch housing, then I will move on to lubing the stem, by basically lubing each side evenly and not too much. This leaves
the final step, by reassembling the parts of the switch, I will need to attatch the stem in the spring thats on the bottom housing, I will then attatch the top housing.

Fifth, I will need to attatch the plate on top of the PCB.

Sixth, I will then install the switches on to the keyboard.

Seventh, I will add the keycaps to be able to use the keyboard.
