# Rasberry Pi home assistant and NAS

## Summary

I am going to build and program a virtual home assistant like Alexa that will hear my voice and respond to my commands. It will be buit with a Rasberry PI, so that I can use it to control my home appliances
This assistant will be placed next to my PC, so with the monitor I will be able to automatize some tasks while turning it on or comanding it via vocal commands
I am really excited about this project because I have never programmed a virtual assistant before and I am really interested in the topic of home automation. I think I can create something really amazing and that can benefit
my workflow overall, and make it more enjoyable.

## Plan

My plan is pretty simple:

1. Get the materials
2. Assemble the rasberry pi system, with memory card, memory, power supply, monitor, etc.
3. Program the virtual assistant
4. Test the system
5. Add features with future update and more programming
6. Repeat point 5 endlessly
