# AI Assistant cum home automation system

## Summary

My aim is to build a AI assistant (like google home, alexa) along with hardware to control my appliances such as light, ac, etc, with raspberry pi, esp32, relays, etc. The next step is to build a AI assistant.

For a reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5rdSA0lvNo

## Plan

Step 1 : Build the circuitry to control the appliances.

Step 2 : Code for the esp32 to read the data from firebase and operate correspondingly.

Step 3 : Step-up the raspberry pi.

Step 4 : Connect the pi with the server(firebase) and build the UI and code for the speech commands and reponses.

Step 5 : Test everything.

Step 5 : Build case for all the open circuitry (in Fusion 360) and print them in 3D Printer.

Step 6 : Connect everything with the AC wiring.

Step 7 : Take the next step to build a complete AI assistant to help me in my other projects

Hidden steps : Brain storming, error correction, multiple testing, reading the documentation, documenting each step, etc.
