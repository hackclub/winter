# AI Assistant home automation system

## Summary

My aim is to build an AI assistant (like Google home, Alexa) along with hardware to control my appliances such as light, ac, etc, with raspberry pi, esp32, relays, etc. The next step is to build an AI assistant.

-The AI should understand my voice commands and respond accordingly.
-The AI will have a UI(animation, floating data, progress tracking, etc).
-It will control my appliances.
-It will also act like a local server for storing data.

## Plan

Step 1 : Build the circuitry to control the appliances.

Step 2 : Code for the esp32 to read the data from firebase and operate correspondingly.

Step 3 : Step-up the raspberry pi.

Step 4 : Connect the pi with the server(firebase) and build the UI and code for the speech commands and reponses.

Step 5 : Test everything.

Step 5 : Build case for all the open circuitry (in Fusion 360) and print them in 3D Printer.

Step 6 : Connect everything with the AC wiring.

Step 7 : Take the next step to build a complete AI assistant to help me in my other projects

Hidden steps : Brain storming, error correction, multiple testing, reading the documentation, documenting each step, etc.
