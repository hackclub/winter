# The One Alarm

## Summary

This is going to be an alarm clock, but not just any alarm clock. This alarm clock is going to be hooked up to a 240V power supply to deliver what might be the ultimate alarm sound that is going to wake everybody up in your house, probably (most likely) even the whole neighbourhood. This project has some personal meaning to me as I have trouble waking up even with the loudest alarm on my phone. Also even if the alarm on my phone does manage to wake me up, it can be turned off just as easily with just a swipe. This alarm clock is going to have you **solve some math problems before you get to turn it off**. Basically ensuring you're already wide awake at that point. Also, frankly, I think the idea of an air raid siren going off every morning to wake up you up is quite hilarious.

Here's a video of the siren I'm intending to use, as you can see, it **will** wake you up. (headphone warning)

## Plan

I intend to purchase the parts needed, which includes the siren, the 3d printer, the filament and the tools needed for soldering the components. After the parts arrive, I'm going to figure out the logic for the alarm clock, which shouldn't be a problem as I'm fairly familiar with coding, the electronics part requires some learning and tinkering but I think I'll figure it out. For the alarm casing, I'm familiar with blender but have never tried 3d printing before so figuring out how to work with a 3d printer, printing the parts etc would be a learning curve. After I secure the components inside the casing, I'm going to mount the siren on top of the alarm and it should be complete. The alarm will also be controlled via an lcd screen, knobs, and buttons which I have.

## Budget

I think the priciest part would be the siren and the 3d printer. For the arduino components (relays, the board itself etc etc), it wouldn't be a problem as I already have them. I will cover the balance by myself.
