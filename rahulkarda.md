# Pi Weather Station

## Summary

I'm going to build a weather display station using Raspberry Pi with a Sense HAT to monitor temperature, humidity, pressure, and orientation. The sensor information is displayed on the sense HAT 8x8 LED matrix, and via the web browser using flask. 
I really excited to build this and the best part is that you can also view the sensor information using the web browser and pointing it to port 5000 of the raspberry pi.

## Plan

First I'll set up my raspberry pi with sense HAT, install the packages for creating the script and then making the 8x8 LED matrix light up and begin scrolling sensor information.
Next step would be to create the scripts and web app using flask.
