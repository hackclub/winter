# Smart screen

## Summary

I would like to make a smarth screen for my room, to have the calendar, the agenda, see the clock and the weather, see the temperature of the room and to appear some interesting news. I always find attractive the idea to have all of this when I wake up in the morning. So my project would be that one, create for me my screen to see every day in the morning all this things. I don’t have a smarth screen, so my plan is to use a couple of Orange Pi Zero, some electronic components, a web server and a monitor to create my own. With all of this I would make screen with a frame to put it in the wall, beacuse thats the point as I see it, and to protect all the components, I will also design a web to connect this with my Notion to show the calendar, the web will also show the clock, the weather, some interesting news, the emails received, the temperature and humidity measured by the sensor, it can even tell what clothes weare from my closet deppending of the wheater, and it can have the option to inteinteract with it using the buttons, to record voice notes.

## Plan

1. Create subjections that allow me to keep all of the tech parts together.
2. Dissasemble the monitor.
3. Assemble the device and plug all of the tech in, on the wall.
4. Design a web interface that connects to the Notion to show the calendar, the clock, the weather, some interesting news, the emails received, the temperature and humidity measured by the sensor, it can even tell what clothes weare from my closet deppending of the wheater, and it can have the option to inteinteract with it using the buttons, to record voice notes.
5. Run the web interface on the local device and that's all!
