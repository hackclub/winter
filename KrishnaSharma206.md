# Object Recognition Warehouse Robot

## Summary

A robot that recohnizes certain shapes and navigates it's way accordingly, I am going to build this robot because I liked the idea of the amazon warehouse
robot and the projects made by a guy named James Bruton, and I really wanna learn about object recognition through this project. I already have some
experience making robots using arduino, so it will be something new for me.

## Plan

I will be using the jetson nano as the brain of this project, the raspberry pi wont be very pwerful for this and the jetson nano will be a better alternative
, I will be using a camera for the detection and I am planning to add more sensors and actuators to it in the future.
1. I will be using my laptop with the jetson nano using a vnc
2. I will first train the ai model on the jetson nano using basic shapes for easier recognition
3. I will build the robot, then program the robot using python
4. I will then finally test it.

## Budget

| Product                | Supplier/Link                                               |  Cost   |
| ---------------        | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Nvidia Jetson nano     | https://www.arrow.com/en/products/945-13450-0000-100/nvidia | $195.00 |
| Rover5 chassis         | https://www.rhydolabz.com/robotics-robotic-kits-c-155_161/dagu-rover-5-2wd-tracked-chassis-without-encoder-p-1258.html | $39 |
| Rover5 expansion plate | https://www.pololu.com/product/1530                         | $16.00  |
| Total                  |                                                             | $250    |

Note: I will be buying rest of the parts required by myself, these are the parts that are not available in my country and also are too expensive for me to buy.
