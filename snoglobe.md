# Snwboard

## Summary

A series of Arduino-like boards meant to be affordable and easy to build.
The snwboard is accompanied by an IDE + simple scripting language meant to let beginners enter the hobby of making.

## Plan

- Design Schematic (Done)
- Design PCB (Done)
- Order PCBs and components
- Assemble boards
- Create IDE and scripting language
- Put on personal storefront for $5 per board (boards are approximately $3.08 to produce individually, including parts shipping + excess parts)
