# 3d printed all terrain vehicle test
## Summary
I am going to build an all terrain Rc model(about a foot long with caterpillars) and test it on its durability and how well it can handle different terrains. This RC model will be made of 3d printed material. This RC model will function and it will move around in different terrain and climates. I am very excited to build this becasue i have been very intrested in RC vehicles and want a job including robers and unmanned vehicles in the future. I also want to find out the prons and cons of all terrain vehicles as well with their limits. The vehicle i will make will be tested on its performance and how well it suits the enviroment it will be tested in. 


## Plan
tools: 
3d printer
soldering iron
dremel tool
wire snipper
screwdriver 

steps:

1. I will print the parts required to make the vehicle with my 3d printer. 
2. clean these pieces up by sanding them down or grinding them with dremel tool
3. assemble and attach the components needed for this model to function. 
4. assemble treads needed for the vehicle
5. mend together pieces with soldering iron
6. paint 
7. add finishing touches to model like fixing sockets.
8. program and make the vheicle able to function. 
9. program moters
10. program the bluetooth system 
11. put together wires to connect motors 
12. put on batteries and check circulation
13. test the torque for the motors.
14. test the vheicles to see if it is working and functioning properly.  
15. test it out in the snow, and different terrains and weather 
16. test compatibility on human made objects like pavement and stairs
