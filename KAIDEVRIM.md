# Project Name
Face ID unlock
## Summary
I want to make a system where depending on who wants to use the computer, the pi will detect them via their face and log them into all the websites under their account and everything. This will be very useful if I want to use this as a guest computer or was teaching someone and they needed to use my computer.

## Plan

I plan on using a raspberry pi that I already own, along with a pikvm so it acts as a troubleshooting device for my pi. My raspberry pi will use the PiKVM to act as a keyboard and mouse, and will also allow me to remotely monitor the user in case they need help. I will be using a camera I have to do the face recognition and everything.
