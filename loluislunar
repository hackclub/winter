# Keyboard Built From The Ground Up Using 3D Printed Rotational Stand

## Summary

I am going to build a mechanical keyboard using switches, a hotswap PCB as opposed to sodering, and bought and 3D printed keycaps to make a keyboard that 
is supported by a 3D printed rotational stand engineered by myself. The keyboard will act as a standard keyboard and the stand will act as a stable ground/desk 
support that can be adjusted for different angles of elevation respective to its horizontal axis. I'm excited to build this because it will be my first time
building a keyboard and implementing 3D printed parts with it. 


## Plan
I am going to first install the switches into the designated sockets on the hotswap pcb plate, testing for connections and functionality. I will then take 
dimensions of the keyboard and sketch out a locked-gear rotational stand to base my CAD model off of. I will then CAD my sketch in ONSHAPE which has built in 
simulated mechanical testing to determine whether the design works as intended. I will then print it off and use the curing station to solidfy each part, 
printed individually and segmented as opposed to curing it with the sun which often takes whole days and leaves un-evenly cured parts. The cable is used to connect 
the keyboard to the computer and the resin is used as material to print the models.
