# 75% Slient keyboard

## Summary

I am going to build a silent 75% keyboard that makes as less sound as possible. It will try to limit the amount of sound I make while typing/gaming. I want to build this because it will be interesting how quiet the keyboard will be and I wont cause as much noise to others. I also want the keyboard to feel smooth pressing down keys and such. I choose a 75% keyboard because I like the arrow keys, but don't want the num pad because it takes up a lot of space. Some items I need to purchase myself because it bypasses the budget of 250 dollars. The items I will buy will be lube and stabilizers.

## Plan

I will buy a keyboard pcb, plate, case, and switches. I will use durock silent linear switches which I will lube myself. I will also buy o-rings as they decrease the amount of sound and increase how fast you can press down keys. Steps: 1. lube switches     2. put first 2 switches in plate then place it in the pcb    3. put stabilizers onto the pcb     4. put pcb into case    5. put o rings on keycaps     6. put keycaps on the switches
