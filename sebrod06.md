# Introduction to Imagineering

## Summary

I'm going to build an animatronic eye mechanism! This project involves using 3D parts that move based on old puppeteering techniques as well as electronic components
that will allow for a joystick to move around the eyes to make the eye movements seem very natural, like they would on an animatronic.

I'm excieted to build this, because my dream job is to become an Imagineer for Disney. Imagineers are those amazing people who engineer and design the various
attractions seen at the Disney parks around the world. One of the main projects that Imagineers are known for though is the detailed animatronics that they build
for the rides at the parks. Those animatronics require a lot of machinery, electronics, and design choices in order for the animatronics to function and look
appropriate for a specific attraction at the parks. In order to prepare myself for that dream job though, I wanted to try and build some of the components needed 
for an animatronic!

## Plan

I am actually going to follow a tutorial, made by a Youtuber named Will Cogley who makes content about cool robotics and animatronics
(https://www.youtube.com/@WillCogley), in order to build this animatronic eye mechanism. The tutorial is very thorough, and Will has generously provided the 3D
printing files as well as what materials are needed for the build. The main point of the project focuses on the 3d printed parts and the servos to work together to 
make the eyes move both up and down and left and right, and then the electrical components working to control those servos using the joystick. I plan on 3D printing
and sanding down the parts that I need prior to the 10 days of project-building, that way I can focus on the electrical and mechanical building portion during
that period of time.
