# Electric Skateboard

## Summary

I'm going to build a electric skateboard that will be powered by a motor and battery, and will be controlled using a remote and an electronic speed controller. You will also be installing an LCD display to monitor the speed and other performance metrics of the skateboard. The project involves assembling a skateboard deck, trucks, wheels, and bearings, as well as installing and connecting the motor, battery, ESC, and LCD display. The goal of the project is to create a functional electric skateboard that can be controlled using a remote. I am excited to build this because it will be a great transportation for me and im just excited to build something that i thought i'd never have a chance to build. Im also going to be making my first vlog out of this project.

## Plan

To build this, I will gather all the necessary materials, assemble the deck and motor, and connect the LCD display to the ESC using wires. Then, I will pair the remote with the ESC. Finally, I will test the setup to identify any flaws and make necessary adjustments to ensure it is functioning properly. Then decided to build the remote control from scratch.
