# Simple Stereo Amp

## Summary

I am going to build a simple stereo amplifier. This amplifier will be able to play audio from a CD player, smartphone, TV, etc. on various speakers I have salvaged from broken electronics. I am excited to build this because I really enjoy listening to and making music but currently have some old cheap computer speakers, and this amplifier would have much higher sound quality.


## Plan

1. Receive parts
2. Assemble and solder amplifier board
3. Test amplifier board
4. Assemble rest of circuit
5. Drill holes in case
6. Mount all items in case
