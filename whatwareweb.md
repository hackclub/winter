# Simple Stereo Amp

## Summary

I am going to build a simple stereo amplifier. This amplifier will be able to play audio from a CD player, smartphone, TV, etc. on various speakers I have salvaged from broken electronics. I am excited to build this because I really enjoy listening to and making music but currently have some old cheap computer speakers, and this amplifier would have much higher sound quality.


## Plan

1. Receive parts
2. Assemble and solder amplifier board (day 1-2)
3. Test amplifier board (day 2)
4. Assemble rest of circuit (day 3-7)
5. Drill holes in case (day 8)
6. Mount all items in case (day 9)
7. Final assembly and testing (day 10)

#### Circuitry plan:
- DC jack + connected to power switch
- DC jack gnd connected to gnd
- Line in LR jacks + connected to input selector switch
- Input selector connected to volume control knob potentiometer
- Volume control potentiometer - one pole to ground, one pole to output, wiper to signal
- Output of volume control connected to amplifier
- +12V connected to amplifier +12V
- Speaker output terminals connected to amplifier speaker output



#### Physical plan:
- DC jack, input switch, speaker terminals, line in jacks, power switch, and volume control have hole drilled in the plastic box and screw/bolt mounted
- Heat sinks adhered to amplifier chip
- Amplifier mounted with screws in box
