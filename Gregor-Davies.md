# Project Name

Greenpower Racing Go Kart Telemetry

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

I am planning to build a telemetry system for my team's greenpower racing go-kart (See link for the greenpower competition: https://www.greenpower.co.uk/). The main goal is to be able to record: The motor temperature, Heatsink temperature, Speed, Current and voltage of the vehicle and display it for the driver and send it back to the pitstops. I am excited to build this as I believe that this could change how our team races while contributing opensource hardware and software. Currently, no full telemetry system is open-source only parts of the hardware or software of the system.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

I have been researching ways to implement different sensors that meet our requirements in the Arduino programming language. By doing this I can work with preexisting libraries and code examples which will reduce the development time. The tools I will be using are the Arduino IDE for programming, 3D printing for the mounting hardware of the telemetry, A wire crimper for dupoint connections for the system and a soldering iron for other connections. The plan is to connect the sensors to the Arduino first off to test the sensors if they work fully, then using the initial connections I will write a preliminary version of the software to test all the sensors together. After that, I will make the final connections of the sensors and design and print mounting hardware for the system. After the final connections are done I will do the final software version that will be used.
