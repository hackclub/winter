# IOT remote control system(IRCS)

## Summary
I have had a strong interest in computers since the beginning of my elementary school. I go from software to hardware. I have built many projects through MCU, development board. These experiences have given me more love for computers, and let me learn more programming languages and get in touch with more hardware.  

Do you want to remotely turn on your home devices, computers, etc. when you are out? IRCS did just that. When you are on the go, you only need to click on the intuitive visualization panel, and your corresponding equipment will be turned on.  



## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
