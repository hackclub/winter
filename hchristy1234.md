# Multi-Function Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

I'm going to build a custom 60% mechanical keyboard that can control my room and assist in productivity (in addition to acting as a keyboard). I will also make a custom coiled USB cable for the keyboard. Special functions of the keyboard would include:
- Custom textured/designed 3D-printed keycaps for certain specified keys (e.g. a calico cat sticking out of the shift key would be very cute!)
- Control the RGB lights in my room with specific key combos
- Custom-coded "modes"
  - "Study Mode" -- the keyboard stops working on certain websites/apps for a certain amount of time (+ backlights on keyboard could act as a pomodoro timer)
  - "Ghost Mode" -- when I activate this mode, the keyboard will start ghost-typing random words (could be really funny to let someone borrow the keyboard to write an essay ... and then it suddenly starts inserting random words!)

Goals:
- Gain familiarity with CAD and 3D-printing
- Learn how to solder
- Learn how to make a functioning cable
- Explore the intersection between software & hardware to create smart-room controls + code keyboard modes

## Plan

Pt. 1 Keyboard:
- Gain familiarity with Fusion360 via online tutorials
- 3D-design  keycaps (with 3D texture/design) for W, A, S, D keys + F, J keys + Numeric Row to allow for more accessible typing experience (the non-customized keycaps will be purchased)
- 3D-print keycaps using school's or friend's 3D-printer
- Paint keycaps using paint + add some type of acrylic sealer to make sure paint doesnt chip + increase aesthetics
- Cut foam for sound dampening
- Lube switches & stabilizers
- Solder switches to the PCB
- Assemble remaining keyboard components
- Create keyboard firmware with Vial
- Flash smart plug (connected to my room's RGB lights) with open source Tasmota firmware for local control

Pt. 2 Cable:
- Sleve cable & secure sleeves using hair dryer or lighter
- Coil cable around metal rod + apply heat
- Strip cable tips using wire stripper
- Strip the 4 inner wire tips to reveal metal tips
- Solder USB connectors onto the cable
- Install heat shrinks
- Reverse coil using tape & metal rod
