# Multi-Function Mechanical Keyboard

## Summary

I am going to build a 65% mechanical keyboard that can control my room and assist in my productivity (in addition to acting as a keyboard).  
"study mode" -- the keyboard stops working on certain websites/apps for a certain amount of time

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
- 
- Create keyboard firmware with Vial
- Flash smart plug with open source Tasmota firmware for local control
-
