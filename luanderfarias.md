# Simplo VR

## Summary

Simplo VR is a cheap virtual reality headset with 6-dof and hand tracking with support for steamvr. made for the community by the community, simplo is the easiest way to enter in the virtual reality worlds without paying a fortune...

Fully open-source and customizable, made to be refined and improved.

## Plan

Simplo is gonna be roadmaped based on "modules". which is basically the functions necessary till it gets ready.
- chasis - the basic process of building a pretty simple frame just to support the screen and cameras.
- 6-dof -  Code the gyroscope and the webcam app to make the headset go 6-dof.
- steamvr - Code the main thing. A communication with steam to transfer the headset information to the game.
- hand-tracking - Finally, code the hand tracking thing, which is supposed to be a replacement for the controllers.
- Simplo-software/website - code the website to present the project to the world and the software for configuration, calibration, setup, etc...
- Finishing - gonna make a new frame (probably 3D printed), make the code more readable, etc...
