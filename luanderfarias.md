# Simplo VR

## Summary

Simplo VR is a cheap virtual reality headset with 6-dof and support for steamvr. made for the community by the community, simplo is the easiest way to enter in the virtual reality worlds without paying a fortune...

we gonna try our best to develop a headset with 6-dof tracking, maybe hand tracking and a lot of stuff to make the project not only one of the cheapiest ways to enter vr, but one of the better ones!

Fully open-source and customizable, made to be refined and improved.

## Plan

Simplo is gonna be roadmaped based on "modules". which is basically the functions necessary till it gets ready.
- chasis - the basic process of building a pretty simple frame just to support the screen. gonna make it from cardboard or popsticks at first but when i finally make a final design i'm gonna 3d print it.
- 6-dof -  Code the accelerometer/gyroscope in a arduino and the webcam app to full-body tracking and positioning the headset to make the headset go 6-dof.
- steamvr - Code the main thing. A communication with steam to transfer the headset information to the game. gonna try to offer support for all games but i don't promise it lol.
- Simplo-software/website - code the website to present the project to the world and the software for configuration, calibration, setup, etc...
- Finishing - gonna make the new frame (probably 3D printed), make the code more readable, etc...

## Research
Simplo is developed based on other open-source vr headsets out there. Here are some of the links for the repositories that inspires simplo:
