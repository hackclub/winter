# Smart Image Classification

## Summary

I am going to build a deep learning realtime image classification and object detection program using computer vision including the use of live cameras with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

## Plan

1. Assemble the device by conncting the [wireless module](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-AC8265-Wireless-Developer-Support-Bluetooth/dp/B07V9B5C6M) and [camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ER2SKFS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=AIKUR5C8RLL4Z&psc=1) to the [SBC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084DSDDLT/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1).
2. Flash the OS image to the [SD card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09B1F9L52/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1).
3. Connect and set up the camera to interface with the hardware.
4. Code my own computer vision recognition program in Python and C++.
5. Create an image classification interface.
6. Train my image classification model.
7. Create an additional interface for object recognition.
8. Train my object recognition model.
9. Run the created image classification and object recognition models and enjoy the results!
