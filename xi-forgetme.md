# Mini Home NAS - It can also be a mobile host

## Summary

Hello!

Thank you for reading my project, just as the title, this is a portable private cloud.

This project is made for a home NAS to storage data locally rather than storage them on clouds.

As the development of information technologyï¼Œ more and more data are generated in people's lives.

They may like to storage them on clouds like iCloud, MEGA etc. However, the high price makes the storage of data generate a lot of unnecessary expenses.

By the way, they store the data on the cloud and the sync of the data is very slow, so I just wanna build a mini home-stay cloud as a private NAS for people.

Programmers can also build a local git repo.

## Plan
### STEP 1
Assemble a server

### STEP 2
Install Linux on SSD, I gotta use Ubuntu and install useful tools like Python3, Nginx, MySQL, Libreoffice etc.

### STEP 3
Install private cloud websites like ownCloud (http://owncloud.org/), Gitea (https://gitea.io/), or write by self lol.

### STEP 4
Set a static IP address, (forwarding if you need to visit from the Internet but you don't have an public IP).

### STEP 5
Setup your passwords, and something else (if you need).

### STEP 6
That all (^_^)
