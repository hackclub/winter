# Mini Home NAS - It can also be a portable server.

## Summary

Hello!

Thank you for reading my project, just as the title, this is a portable private cloud.

This project is made for a home NAS to storage data locally rather than storage them on clouds.

As the development of information technology， more and more data are generated in people's lives.

They may like to storage them on clouds like iCloud, MEGA etc. However, the high price makes the storage of data generate a lot of unnecessary expenses.

By the way, they store the data on the cloud and the sync of the data is very slow, so I just wanna build a mini home-stay cloud as a private NAS for people.

Programmers can also build a local git repo.

The last one, it can also be a game server for people to build mobile cloud game station everywhere.

## Plan
### STEP 1
Install Linux and necessary software in SSD driver with another computer, and plugin in the X99M.

### STEP 2
Plugin CPU, GPU and RAM in the mother board.

### STEP 3
Install the power，put there hardware in a suitcase so that you can plugin in anywhere you want.

### STEP 4
Boot, and connect to the Internet, **set IP address to be static**.

### STEP 5
Log in and configure what you need.

### STEP 6
Then you can connect or access the server everywhere.

### STEP 7
Now you can move the server everywhere as long as you are able to use electricity.
