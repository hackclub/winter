## Summary

> A phonograph, in its later forms also called a gramophone (as a trademark since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910) or since the 1940s called a record player, or more recently a turntable, is a device for the mechanical and analogue recording and reproduction of sound. [Wikipedia]

Playing music just ain't as fun anymore. _**HEY SIRI**_ is no where near as cool as spinning a physical record. Team 502, here. We're going to create a modern version of the Gramophone called the "Gramophone-502x".

## Plan

There are three parts to Gramophone-502x: the shell, the electronics, and the records.

### The Chassis

The shell will be 3D-printed and laser cut at @arshshrivastavaa's school. We'll need to use part of the grant to pay for filament and wood. We'll design the shell in Fusion360.

### The Electronics

Gramophone-502x will read embedded NFC tags to know which song to play when. Gramophone-502x will be connected to Spotify through a NodeMCU. For now, we'll play the songs on Spotify through a pre-owned Google Home Mini. A motor will "spin" the record. 

Lastly, inspired by [@amhenikoff](https://github.com/amhenikoff) & [@phultquist](https://github.com/phultquist)'s [Frame](https://github.com/phultquist/frame) project from SoM, we're going to look into creating a RGB-mode for Gramophone-502x.

### The Records

Honestly, making the records is going to require a bit of experimentation! Our current plan is to cast them in resin and then find a way to sneak a thin NFC tag on them.

###### The purpose of "Assorted Circuit Components" is to serve as a buffer fund we can use if we need a random component such as a resistor. We live near Sim Lim Square, a mall with countless electronics distributors, and can dash over there to grab common components whilst making. They accept contactless payments and we can use our HCB cards.
