# PianoBot

## Summary

We are going to build a self-playing piano. Our team has 4 members. One of our group member’s has a brother who is very skilled at playing the piano. Although we do not possess the same talent as he does, we are determined to mimic his abilities through innovation and technology. Our design consists of solenoids placed on top of every key (we’re only doing 2 octaves to start) that is controlled by a Teensy (Using Arduino C++) that reads a MIDI roll and pushes the solenoids accordingly. We are not following any guides. We will use Fusion360 to CAD our own models.

## Plan

Prototype Circuit with LEDs
Write code to read MIDI roll and turn on and off LEDs accordingly
Hook up solenoids and solenoid drivers in place of LEDs
Build frame on piano
3d print mounts for all parts
Line up parts and mounts on frame and attach
Test and tweak.
