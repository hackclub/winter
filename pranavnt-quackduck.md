# FSC (full self cycling Bike 

## Summary

We're building an ebike that has full self cycling â€“ you can press a button and it will cruise at ~8mph on a trail, detecting lanes and the side of the trail, and automatically steer.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
